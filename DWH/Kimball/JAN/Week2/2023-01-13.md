- presentation area should be structured around business process measurement events ^bd86b5
- all dim structures must be built using conformed dimensions
	- basis for enterprise data warehouse bus arch
	- very important
- without shared, conformed dimensions, a dim model becomes a standalone app
- presentation area consists of dozens of dimensional models with many of the associated dim tables shared across fact tables
- data must not be structured according to individual departments' interpretation of data

## Business Intelligence Apps:
- refers to the range of capabilities provided to business users to leverage the data in the presentation area for decision making
- all BI apps query the data in the DW/BI presentation area
- ad hoc query tools - used by techical users
- business users use prebuilt parameter driven apps and templates
	- no need to construct the query

## Analogy b/w DW/BI components and Restaurant:
- ETL systems ~ Kitchen
- before the chefs get to convert the raw material to dishes, significant time is spent on designing the workspace layout and components
- ETL systems should be laid out and designed long before any extraction
- Data presentation and BI form the Dining room
- like menus DPA and BI apps provides metadata, prebuilt parameterized apps to describe what data is available

## Alternate DW/BI architectures
- there are different architectures other than [[2023-01-10#Kimball's DW/BI arch:]]
- the differences b/w these archs and kimballs's have softened
- there is a role for dimensional modelling in every arch
- architecture is just a means to satisfy the business users's data requirements
	- there are multiple means
