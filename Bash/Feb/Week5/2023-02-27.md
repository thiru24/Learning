## tail and head
- simple tools that allow us to print lines on top/bottom of a file
	- **tail -n3 /etc/passwd** prints the last 3 lines from /etc/passwd
	- **head -n3 /etc/passwd|tail -n1** prints the 3rd line from /etc/passwd
- if no number is given as an arg - > 10 lines

## sed
- stream editor
- external command
- allows to edit files even if there is no full screen available
- sed is a programming lang at its own
- sed designed to write to std out by default
- sed -n 5p /etc/passwd
	- prints 5th line
- sed -i s/old/new/g ~/myfile
	- inplace substituition of string 'old' with 'new' global
- sed -i -e '2d' ~/myfile
	- inplace deletion of second line
- for i in \*conf;do sed -i 's/old/new/g' $i; done
	- in place global substituition of string 'old' with 'new' for many files recursively for all files that end with conf

## awk
- useful in filtering txt
- awk -F : '{ print $4 }' /etc/passwd
	- print only field 4, field delimiter is :
- awk -F : '/user/ { print $4 }' /etc/passwd
	- print only field 4, field delimiter is : but only rows where string 'user' is present
- awk -F : '$3>999 {print $1} /etc/passwd'
	- only print field 1 if field 3 has a value bigger than 999
- external command

## considering external tools and performance
- try to avoid external tools
	- external tools and all the lib they require(dependencies) need to be fetched from disk, which is relatively slow
	- also, external tools are operating sys specific, sometimes even distribution specific, which makes the script less portable
- **type** to find out if a tool is external or not
- to measure performance, use **time myscript** to measure the amount of time it takes to run a script with or without external script
- some tools are available as both internal and external tools
- in terms of search precedence or execution precedence, internal tools always win
- internal commands are cd and time
- awk external:

- when comparing two utilities for a functionality use the one with less library overhead

 - choose cut instead for field printing

- bin/sh is a symbolic to bin/dash -> light weight than bash

# Creating our first shell script
## Choosing an editor
- editor is a computer prog
	- allows us to store unformatted text
	- ascii text
	- lines of text with just crlf codes at the end of the line
	- crlf - carrier return line feed
- editor should offer syntax highlighting
- vim, nano, gedit
## IDEs
- integrated development env
- provides comprehensive tools for programmers to develop s/w
- IDEs should contain at least the following
	- source code editor
	- build automation tool
	- debugger
- shell scripts dont go through the normal cycle of s/w development
