# BI

- Two environments:
	 1. Data to Info
	 2. Info to Knowledge

- In 2nd env, analytical tools are made available to users to access and analyze info from env1
- Sepearate attention is required for both these envs
- the two envs are complementary and have to work together

## [[Defining features of DWH]]:

### Subject-oriented:

- In operational systems, data is grouped and stored by individual applications
- datasets in operational systems are organized around individual applications in order to support them
- Inside these datasets, there will be data related to the different functionalities of the app
	- ex: datasets for an order processing app. These data sets provide data for all the functions of entering orders, checking stocks etc.
- data sets provide data for the specific apps to function
- In DWH, the data is grouped and stored by real-world **business subjects**, not by applications
- Business subjects are subjects that are critical to the enterprise.
	- for a manufacturing company: 1. Sales 2. Shipments 3. inventories

### Integrated:

- for proper decision making, the data should be complete
- pull relevant data from all sources
- source data resides in various dbs, files etc.
- data can be coming from internal and external sources.
- different sources mean difference in 
	- how they are represented(Schema)
	- how thery are stored(format)
- Since there are going to be inconsistencies due to differences above -> standardize before moving to DWH

some items that need standardizing:
- naming conventions
- character codes
- data attributes
- measurements

### Time-Variant Data:
- dwh has to store historical data
- every data structure in a dwh contains the time element
- time variant nature of data in a dwh allows us to:
	- analyze past
	- relates information to the present
	- forecast the future
