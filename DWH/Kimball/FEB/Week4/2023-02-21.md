# Extending Retail schema
- if years after the relational schema is introduced let's say that the store is now able to register customer details to identify frequent shoppers:
	- this detail helps in identifying customer buying patterns
	- add as a dim
	- one key in the dim for unidentified historical customer(old fact rows)
	- one key in the dime for unidentified customer(current customers for whom details are not available)
	- obviously there should be a new column in the fact table to accomodate the new dim
	- if we had designed the schema at a summarized grain - adding dimension becomes difficult
		- because some dims do not apply at higher grains
- a well designed granular dim model will be able to absorb significant changes, without invalidating the existing BI apps
- the changes can be:
	- new dim attr:
		- easily add dim attrs without disturbing existing BI apps
		- if the new attrs only apply after a certain time -> set the attrs for those old dim rows as not available
		- if the business users want to track historical changes of this attr, we have to be careful of SCD -> [[Contents#Chapter5]]
	- new dims
	- new measured facts:
		- simplest case is when the fact is available in the same measurement event and in the same grain as the existing facts
		- if fact values are applicable only after a point in time -> include null for the appropriate rows
		- if the fact does not match with the grain of the fact table -> fact table of it's own

## Factless fact tables
- in our retail schema one question that cannot be answered:
	- what product on promotion that was not sold
	- the fact table only registers SKUs that were sold
	- no fact row with facts as 0 to indicate unsold SKUs -> makes the table huge
- we need something to answer what did not happen
- promotion coverage fact table:
	- table keys:
		- date
		- product
		- store
		- promotion
	- grain diff:
		- one row for each product that is under promotion in a store on each day(or week)
		- product is entered even if it is not sold
	- no metrics in here
	- factless fact table because it only captures the relationship b/w the involved keys -> no metrics
	- answer to our question: 
		- query the factless fact table for what products were on promotion on a given day
		- query the main fact table to get what products sold on the same day
		- ans is set difference b/w 1st and second
- in olap cubes there are cells for non behaviour- > so easy in OLAP cubes to answer the above ques
