## shift
- used to shift the positional parameters to the left
- if three arg given and if we use shift once -> only the second and last arg remaining
- shift can be used with arg(number), to shift the positional params to the left by that number
	- shift 3 -> three arguments are shifted
- useful to remove args after processing them

## Using command substituition
- used to work with the result of a comman instead of a static val
- use this to refer to values that are dynamic
	- today=$(date +%d-%m-%y)
	- this is the standard format
	- there are other formats as well
- command subs can be done in two ways which are not fundamentally diff
	- today=$(date +%d-%m-%y)
	- today=\`date +%d-%m-%y\` - > back tick

## Using here docs
- a here doc used as a scripted alternative that can be provided by the i/p redirction
- section of sode that acts as a separate file
- is a multiline string or a file literal for sending i/p streams to other commands and programs
- syntax:
```
#!/bin/bash

[COMMAND] <<[-] 'DELIMITER'
  Line 1
  Line 2
  ...
DELIMITER
```
- consists:
	- COMMAND is optional. Works for every command that accepts redirection
	- << - > to redirect here doc to comman
	- - is a parameter for tab suppression
	- DELIMITER in the first line defines a heredoc delimiter token
		- END, EOT, EOF are most comman
	- DELIMITER at the end indicates end of heredoc
- heredoc contains any  num of lines with strings, var, commands and other inputs
