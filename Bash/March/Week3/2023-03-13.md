## break and continue
- **break** is used to leave a loop straight away
	- for exceptional situations
- **continue** is used to stop running the current iteration and begin the next one
	- useful if a situation was encountered that makes it impossible to proceed

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z $1 ]
then
        echo "No arguments provided!"
        exit 1
fi
for i in $@
do
        free=$(free -m|head -2|tail -1|awk '{print $4}')
        if [[ $free -le 44256 ]]
        then
                echo Free memory is low: $free
                break
        fi
        sudo apt install -y $i
        sudo systemctl enable --now $i
done
```
## Using Advanced Scripting options
- option is an argument that changes script behaviour
- use **while getopts "ab:" opts** to evaluate options a and b, and while evaluating them, put them in a temp variable opts
	- if we are going to work with options, we will have to work with while and getopts (Builtin)
	- getopts is evaluating the string that is provided as part of the command typed
	- in the above case "a" is a straight option which means we use it as -a
	- "b" is an option that works with an option argument
		- option argument is argument to the option
			- ex: useradd **-s /bin/bash** bob
			- in this case /bin/bash is the option arg
	- next, use **case $opts** to define what should happen if a specific option was encountered
```
#!/bin/bash

while getopts "hs:x:" arg # : specifies that we are expecting option arg for s and x
do
        case $arg in
                h)
                        echo "h is the option"
                        ;;
                s)
                        echo "s is the option" $arg $OPTARG #OPTARG will 
                        ;;       #hold the value of option argument for s
				 x)
                        echo "x is the option" $arg $OPTARG
                        echo "$OPTIONIND" # prints the 
        esac
done
```
- getopts takes care of throwing an error whenever the option is not valid or there is no option arg provided
- the argument provided to the option is treated as a positional arg as well, can be accessed by $number
-
