## fundamental concepts of Kimball Dim modeling Tech:

## Business processes:
- operational activities performed by the org
	- taking an order
	- processing an insurance claim
	- registering students for a class
	- snapshoting each account/ month
- business process events generate or capture performance metrics that translates to facts in facts tables
- most fact tables focus on the results of a single business process
- choosing the process defines a specific design target
- each business process corresponds to a row in the edwh bus matrix

## Grain
- grain establishes exactly what a single fact table row represents
- declared before choosing dims or facts
- atomic grain refers to the lowest level at which data is captured by the business process
- each proposed fact table grain results in a separate physical table
- one table = one grain

## Dimensions for descriptive context
- provide who, what, when ,where, why and how context surrounding the business process event
- attributes present here is used for grouping and filtering the facts
- whenever possible, a dimension should be single valued when associated with a fact row
- soul of DWH

## Facts for measurements:
- measurements resulting from business processes
- almost always numeric
- single fact table row has a one-to-one relationship to a measurement event as described by the fact table's grain

## Star Schemas and OLAP Cubes
- star schemas are dimensional structures
	- deployed in a RDBMS
- typically consist of fact tables linked to corresponding dim tables with FK/PK relationships
- OLAP Cube: dimensional structure implemented in a multidimensional db
	- can be equivalent in content to relational star schema
	- more often derived from relational star schema
	- contains dims and facts
	- accessed with languages of higher analytic capabilities than SQL -> XMLA, MDX
	- final step in deploying a dimensional DW/BI sys
	- may exist as an agg structure based on an atomic relational star schema
## Graceful extensions to Dim models
- dim models are resilient when data relationships change
- we can do the following without disturbing any of the existing BI queries or apps:
	- facts consistent with the grain of an existing fact table can be added by creating new cols
	- dims can be added by creating a new FK col
	- attributes can be added to a dim table by creating a col
	- grain can be made more atomic by adding attributes to existing dim tables, should not change col names
