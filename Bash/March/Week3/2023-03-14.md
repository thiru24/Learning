## Using variables in function
- irrespective of where the variables are defined, they have a global scope
	- even if defined inside the functions
- use the local keyword to define variables with a local scope inside of a function
```
#!/bin/bash

var1="hello"

myfun () {
        local var2=my # only visible inside this function
        var3=dear
        echo $var1 $var2 $var3
}
echo before calling the function var1=$var1 var2=$var2 var3=$var3
myfun
echo after calling the function var1=$var1 var2=$var2 var3=$var3

O/P:
before calling the function var1=hello var2= var3=
hello my dear
after calling the function var1=hello var2= var3=dear
```

```
#!/bin/bash

var1="hello"

myfun () {
        local var1=my # same var name, but locally created
        var3=dear
        echo $var1 $var3
}
echo before calling the function var1=$var1 var3=$var3
myfun
echo after calling the function var1=$var1 var3=$var3 # no change to var1 here
O/p:
before calling the function var1=hello var3=
my dear
after calling the function var1=hello var3=dear
```

```
#!/bin/bash

var1="hello"

myfun () {
        var1=my # modification of var1 is global
        var3=dear
        echo $var1 $var3
}
echo before calling the function var1=$var1 var3=$var3
myfun
echo after calling the function var1=$var1 var3=$var3

O/p:
before calling the function var1=hello var3=
my dear
after calling the function var1=my var3=dear #value of var1 is modified
```

## Menus in Bash scripts
- the select statement can be used to select a menu
- use PS3 to define a menu prompt
	- ps3  third prompt
	- ps4 is fourth prompt
		- ps3 and ps4 are custom prompts
	- ps1 is primary prompt
	- ps2 is secondary prompt
		- what we would get if we dont properly end a command
- the select statement embeds a case statement
- after executing a menu option, we will get back to the menu
- use break to get out of the menu
- $REPLY is a default variable that contains the string that was entered at the prompt
- the select statement can refer to the choices directly.
	- if the choices contain spaces, we will need to use an array instead
```
#!/bin/bash

PS3="Enter your choice: "
options=("OPTION 1" "OPTION 2" "OPTION 3" "QUIT")

select opt in "${options[@]}" # @ is our arg
do
        case $opt in
                "OPTION 1")
                        echo "you have selected option 1"
                        ;;

                "OPTION 2")
                        echo "you have selected option 2"
                        ;;
                "OPTION 3")
                        echo "you have selected $REPLY with is $opt"
                        ;;
                "QUIT")
                        break
                        ;;
                *)
                        echo "invalid option $REPLY"
                        ;;
        esac
done
```
- the menu can be exited using Ctrl + C
## Using trap
- trap is used to run a command on catching a signal
- SIGKILL (kill -9) cannot be trapped
- signals are specific s/w interrupts that can be sent to a command
- use man 7 signal or trap -l for an overview
- trap is useful to run commands upon receiving a signal
- use it to catch signals that we dont want to happen in the script, like INT(ctrl c)
- or use it on exit, to define tasks that should happen when the script properly exits
	- this is better than just running a command at the end of the script, because that will only run if the script reaches the end

```
trap "echo ignoring signal" INT TERM # ignoring ctrl c and sigterm(15)
echo pid is $$ # displays PID
# this script can be killed by SIGKILL(9)
while : # colon is the useless command, it always executes successfully
do      # alternative to while true
	sleep 60
done
```

```
#!/bin/bash
trap 'rm -f /tmp/ladder' INT # on receiving ctrl C, delete the file
rm /tmp/ladder 2>/dev/null
touch /tmp/ladder
ls -l /tmp/ladder
echo trap me if you can
sleep 300 # if this script naturally exits the file ladder exists
```

```
#!/bin/bash

echo the PID is $$
rm -f /tmp/trapfile 2>/dev/null
touch /tmp/trapfile
ls -l /tmp/trapfile

sleep 5
trap 'rm -f /tmp/trapfile' EXIT # if the script reaches its natural end
# the rm command is executed
```

```
#!/bin/bash

ctrlc_count=0

function no_ctrlc()
{
        let ctrlc_count++
        echo
        if [[ $ctrlc_count == 1 ]]; then
                echo "Don\'t do that." 
        elif [[ $ctrlc_count == 2 ]]; then
                echo "if you\'re sure, do it once more." 
        else
                echo "Okay, bye."
                exit
        fi
}

# define the trap that reacts on ctrl-c
trap no_ctrlc SIGINT

# run the command on something that will be restarted after receiving SIGINT
# this fails if you do it on while sleep 10000
while true
do
        echo doing nothing for a long time
        sleep 10000
done
