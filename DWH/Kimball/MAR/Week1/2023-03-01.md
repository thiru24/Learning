## Inventory accumulating snapshots
- used for process with
	- definite beginning
	- definite ending 
	- clearly identifiable milestones in b/w
- one row placed when a product received at the WH
- the lifecycle of the product is tracked on this single fact row
	- until it leaves the wh
- in this example, Acc ss is only possible if we can distinguish b/w the products received in one shipment with another
	- or if there is a lot number
- in our case let us define the milestones
	- receiving
	- inspecting
	- bin placement
	- shipping
- A bin location isÂ **the smallest addressable unit of space in a warehouse where your goods are stored**.
- each acc ss fact table row is updated repeatedly
	- until products received in a lot are completely depleted from the wh

## Fact table types
- based on :![[2023-01-06#^c9be2a]]
- the above types are true regardless of industry
- often we need two complementary fact tables to get the complete picture of the business
|                     | transaction                              | Periodic                                                      | accumulating                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| periodicity         | discrete txn point in time               | recurring snapshots at regular periodic intervals             | intemerdiate time span for evolving pipeline       |
| grain               | 1 row per txn or txn line                | 1 row per snapshot period plus other dimensions(ex: products) | one row per pipeline occurence                     |
| date dims           | txn date                                 | snapshot date                                                 | multiple dates for pipeline's key milestones       |
| facts               | txn performance                          | cumulative performance for time interval                      | performance for pipeline occurence                 |
| fact table sparsity | sparse or dense, depending upon activity | dense                                                         | sparse or dense, depending upon pipeline occurence |
| fact table updates  | no updates unless error correction       | no updates, unless error corrections                          | updated whenever pipeline activity occurs          |

- rows will be inserted to txn ft only if there is some activity, ex: purchase
- we cannot survive on txn alone
- periodic snapshot tables usually have fewer dims
- periodic snapshot tables share many dims with txn tables
	- the diff txn types in txn table might confuse about the impact it has on the inventory
	- periodic dim is the solution
		- simple
		- clear
		- what happened in a period with metrics
- more facts in periodic snapshot tables
- if the OSS does not handle the snapshot logic, ETL should
