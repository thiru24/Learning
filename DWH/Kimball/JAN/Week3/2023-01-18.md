## Hybrid Hub-and-Spoke and Kimball Architecture

![[Pasted image 20230118170732.png]]

- EDWH completely off limits to BI apps
	- merely source to populte Kimball-esque presentation area where data is
		- dimensional
		- atomic&agged
		- process-centric
		- conforms to edw bus architecture
- can be called as best of both worlds
- may leverage prexisting central repo
- addresses query issues which related to the 3NF
- if starting from scratch this approach costly and takes more time
- redundant storage of atomic data

## Dimensional Modeling Myths

#### Myth 1: Dim modeling only for summary data
- root cause of badly designed dim models
- cannot predict the question by business users
	- better to have data at the most detailed level
- summary data should be present to address common queries with better performance
- corollary of this first myth is that only a limited amount of data should be stored in dimensional structures
	- dim model does not prohibit storing extensive history data
	- the amount of history in a dim model should solely depend on the business req

#### Myth 2: Dim models are Departmental, not Enterprise
- dim models should be structured around business processes and not departments

- ex: orders, invoices and service calls
- multiple business functions want to analyze the same metrics from a single business process
- multiple extracts of the same source data should be avoided
	- should not create multiple, inconsistent analytic databases from the same source

#### Myth 3: Dimensional models are not scalable
- extremely scalable
- fact tables with billions and trillions of records have been reported
- db vendors have accepted DW/BI and continue to support via including capabilities that will optimize performance and scalability

- dim models answer the same questions with ease than the normalized models
