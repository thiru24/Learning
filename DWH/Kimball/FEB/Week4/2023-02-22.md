# Dimension and fact table keys

## Dimension Table Surrogate Keys
- row identifier for DIM should be a surrogate key
	- not an operational system identifier - > natural key
- surrogate keys are also known as:
	- meaningless 
	- integer
	- non-natural
	- artificial
	- synthetic 
- a natural key might not stand the test of time - > might be invalidated later
- have a backend cross reference table which has a mapping b/w NK from diff sources to a single SK ^557904
	- helpful in substituiting NK with SK
### Adv of surrogate keys:
- buffer the dwh from operational changes
	- enable dwh team to maintain the control of DWH
	- we do not have to follow operational procedures involved in production codes lifecycle
	- in many org, invalid account num or obsolete product codes get re asssigned after a period of dormancy
		- this can be allowed in the operational system because they do not hold too much past data
		- but DWH holds data for a long time
		- surrogate key enables differentiation b/w the two identical natural keys
- integrate multiple source sys
	- helps in integrating multiple source systems
		- even if they lack consistent source keys
		- multiple natural keys on the back end are mapped to the same surrogate key
			- using a back room mapping table
- improve performance
	- SK are usually integers that start of small
	- while NK are bulky alphanumerics or a group of fields
	- smaller SKs translates into smaller fact tables, smaller fact table indexes
	- typically 4 byte integer is enough for most Dim keys
- handle null or unknown condns
	- special SK values are used to record special cases where there no respective operational NK
		- no promotion, unidentified cust
		- especially helpful in date dimensions - where there is no date value to determine "Date yet to be determined" or "Date is not applicable"
- Support Dimension attr change tracking
	- especially when attrs related to a NK might change
## Dimension Natural and Durable Supernatural Keys
- NK are stored as attr in dims
	- if NK comes from multiple sources, usually the values are prepended with the operational source: source|NK
		- ex: CRM|1323
- in dim with attr change tracking, it is important to have an identifier that uniquely and reliably identifies the dim entity across its attr changes 
- natural key is bound to change due to many reasons
- if dim's natural keys are not proteccted and preserved ETL should assign permanent durable identitfiers
	- durable supernatural keys
	- controlled by DW/BI sys
	- immutable
	- part of dim
	- not a replacement for a dim table's SK
