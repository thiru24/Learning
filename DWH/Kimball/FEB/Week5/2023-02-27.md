## Centipede fact tables with too many dims
- fact tables in dimensional schema
	- higly normalized
	- compact
- designers have an urge to denormalize fact tables
	- do not do it
	- usually done by including more keys than necessary
	- ex:
		- including brand key, category key dept key for respective dims when instead they could all come under one product key
	- introduces many join requirements
- centipede fact tables
- something like the following

- centipede tables do not just affect performance but also take up huge disk space
- indexing becomes difficult as the number of keys increase
- if 25 + dimensions required
	- try to combine correlated attrs into single dim
	- some correlated attrs:
		- hierarchical
		- attrs with high statistical correlation
- it is good decision to combine dims when resulting new single dimension is noticeably smaller than the cartesian product of individual dims
- elements of a single hierarchy should not be represented as different dim tables
- development of columnar databases might solve the space and performance issues faced when using a centipede ft
- columnar db stores each column object as a contiguous object that is heavily indexed for access

## Value chain
- most org have underlying value chain of key business processes
- value chain - natural, logical flow of activities within an organization
- retail store's value chain

- OSS usually produce txns or snapshots at each step of the value chain
- the primary obj of most DW/BI sys are to analyze the performance of these key steps
- each process typically spawns one or more fact tables
	- because each process produces 
		- unique metrics at unique intervals of time
		- at unique granularity
		- unique dimensionality

## Inventory models
1. periodic snapshot
	- inventory tracked for a period
		- one row for each tracked product for a period
		- these periodic snapshot rows appear over time as a series of data layers
2. txn
	- each txn that affects the inventory levels of products is recorded
2. accumulating snapshots
	- one row inserted for every product delivery
	- updated as the product moves through the inventory
- all three models might be necessary in some cases

## Inventory periodic snapshots
- most atomic level of detail in this case:
	- daily inventory levels of each product in each store
		- dims that can be immediately identified:
			- product
			- store
			- date
		- promotion does not come in here as it is involved in the product movement(when the product is bought or sold)
- simplest view of inventory: quantity at hand
- date dim in here is identical to the retail case
- store and product might have more attr that is helpful in the inventory case
	- ex: min reorder quantity, storage req(assuming both are constant)
	- if attrs change for each product by store -> then dont store here
