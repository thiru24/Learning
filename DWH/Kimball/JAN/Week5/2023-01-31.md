## drill across
- means making separate queries against two or more fact tables where the [[2023-01-30#row header]]s of each query consist of identical conformed attr
- known as stitch and multipass query
- trying to query the data with conformed dim attrs
- answer sets are aligned by performing a sort-merge operation on the common dimension attribute row headers.

## Value chain
- natural flow of an org's business processes
	- ex: retailer's value chain: purchasing to warehousing to retail sales
	- general ledger value chain may consist of budgeting to commitments to payments
- OSS produce txns or snapshots at each step of the value chain
- each process produces unique metrics at unique time intervals with unique granularity and dimensionality
- each process typically spawns atleast one atomic fact table

## Enterprise DWH Bus Architecture
- provides an incremental approach to building the enterprise DW/BI sys
- the arch decomposes the DW/BI planning process into manageable pieces by 
	- focusing on the business processes
	- delivers integration by the use of standardized conformed dimensions
		- resused across processes
- technology and database platform independent
- both relational and olap dimensional structures can participate

## Enterprise DWH bus matrix
- essential tool for designing and communicating EDWH bus arch
- rows of the matrix are business processes and columns are dims
- shaded cells represent whether a dim is associated with the BP
	- scanning a col could give info on which dims should be conformed across BPs

## Detailed implementation bus matrix
- more granular bus matrix
	- where each business process row has been expanded to show specific fact tables or OLAP cubes
- more details

## Oppurtunity/Stakeholder Matrix
- after DWHBM has been identified, draft a diff matrix with columns as business functions(depts)
- shade the cells to know which depts are interested in which business process rows

# Dealing with SCD attr
- same dim can have attrs that are handled differently

## type 0:
- retain original
- dim attr value never changes
- facts are always grouped by the original values
- appropriate for any attr labeled original
	- ex: applies to most attr in date dim tables

## type 1:
- overwrite
- reflect the most recent assignment
- destroys history
- does not create additional dim rows
- agg fact tables and OLAP cubes should be recalculated

## type 2:
- add new row
- usage of Surrogate key is mandatory
	- because muiltiple entry for the same natural key
- min of three new cols should be added
	- row effective date/timestamp
	- row exp date/timestamp
	- current row indicator
