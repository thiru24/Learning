## Role playing dims
- single physical dim can be referenced many times in a fact
	- each reference serving a diff role
	- ex: fact table can have diff fk pointing to diff dates in cal dim
	- these cols should have diff names 

## Junk dims
- txnal business processes typically produce many low cardinality flags/indicators
- no need separate dims for each flag and attr
- create single junk dim
- combination of indicator fields
- frequently named as txn profile dimension
	- does not have to cover all possible combination of these flags
	- only combinations that have occured

## Snowflaked dims
- when a hierarchical relationship in a dim table is normalized
	- low cardinality attr appear as secondary tables connected to the base dimension by an attr key
- when this process is repeated with all the dim table's hierarchies - > snowflake structure
- difficult to navigate through for business users
- negatively impact query performance
- info stored is same if snowflake or not

## outrigger dimensions
- a dim table can contain a reference to another dim table
	- ex: account dim can reference date dim(to give detail about when the account was created)
- the secondary dim references are called as outrigger dims
- use sparingly
- correlations to other dims should be demoted to a fact table

# Integration via Conformed Dimensions

### row header
- row header (that is, the grouping column in the SQL query),

## Conformed dimensions
- when do dimensions conform?
	- columns in different dimension tables have the same 
		-  column name
		-  domain content
- info from separate fact tables can be combined in a single report
	-  by the attributes which "conform" across two dims
	- these attr must be connected to the fact tables
- decide the cols with data governance representative
- gives analytical consistency
- When a conformed attribute is used as the row header (that is, the grouping column in the SQL query), the results from the separate fact tables can be aligned on the same rows in a [[2023-01-31#drill-across]] report.

## Shrunken dims
- are conformed dims
- subset of rows and/or columns of the base dim
- shrunken rollup dims are required when constructing [[2023-01-24#Aggregate fact tables or OLAP Cubes]]
- also necessary for business processes that capture data at a higher level of grain
