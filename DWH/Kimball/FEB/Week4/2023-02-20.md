## Null Foreign Key, Attrs and Facts
- typically customers might purchase products that are not under promotion as well
- in this case normally there will not be a FK in the Fact that refers a promotion - > referential integrity issue
- to avoid this circumstance:
	- include a promotion dim row with a unique key: 0 or 1 indicating no promotion condition
- null foreign keys in the fact table should be avoided at all costs
	- include keys in the dim that indicates for the fact that this dim is not applicable
- we sometimes encounter nulls as dim column values
- happens when
	- dim row not fully populated
	- attribute might not be applicable for all dim rows
- in both cases above include a descriptive Not applicable or Unknown
- the issue with null in dims becomes evident when grouping
	- if a user aggregates a fact col1 based on a fully filled **dim column** - > result 1
	- if a user aggregates a fact col1 based on a sparsely filled **dim column** - > result 2
	- result 1 != result 2 - > inconsistent
- facts as null are properly handled when using agg funcs on them

## Other retail sales dimensions
- any descriptive attribute which takes on a single value for fact table measurement event is a good candidate 
	- to be added to an existing dimension or 
	- be it's own dim
- whether a dim should be associated with a fact table - > yes/no based on the grain

## Degenerate dim for txn numbers
- order num, invoice num, txn num all appear as dd
- because descriptive context of the txn has been split into different dims
- these num play an imp role in PK of the fact table
- in retail case, PK = TXN num + Product key
	- identical product should have only one record for a txn
- if we feel some details of the txn are left out even after creating all the other dim
	- create a dim and key is  txn num -> no longer a dd
