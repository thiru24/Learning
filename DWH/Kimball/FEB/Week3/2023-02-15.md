## Current and relative date attr
- most date dim attr are not updated frequently
- there are attr that we can add that might change over time
	- IsCurrentDay, IsCurrentMonth, IsPrior60Days
	- IsCurrentDay should be updated daily - > helpful in creating reports on a daily basis
	- IsCurrentDay willl not point to Current date, but Current_date-1(DWH loads data for day the next day)

## Time-of-day as a dimension or fact
- the grain of the date dim should not be one row per minute/second!
	- too many rows
	- date dim should be as compact as possible, as it is one of the major dim that will be used in filtering
- if the time component is neccesary in analysis
	- construct another dim that has one row per time period
	- one row per minute - > results 1440 rows in total
	- one row per 15 minute
	- useful for time-of-day grouping
- if there is no need for time-of-day grouping or constraining, have timestamp columns in fact

## Product dimension
- every single product in a store
- SKU(stock keeping units) - number(alphanumeric) that retailers assign to products to keep track of stock levels internally
	- if the same product has different colors and sizes, each variation has a unique SKU number
- almost always sourced from operational product master file
- each POS system has an appropriate version of the product master file downloaded at periodic intervals
### Flatten many-to-one hierarchies
- product dimension represent the many descriptive attrs of each SKU
- merchandise hierarchy is an important group of attrs
- individual SKUs - > brands - > categories - > departments
- each of the above: many to one relationship

- if there are 300,000 SKUs and there are only 50 departments  
	- 1 department description might be repeated nearly 6000 times - >fine
	- do not normalize
- keeping the repeated low-cardinality values in the primary dimension table is fundamental technique in dimensional modeling
- many attrs in product dim not part of the merch hierarchy
- we can browse through the dim attrs regardless of whether they belong to the merch hierarchy

## Attrs with embedded meaning
- operational product codes (SKU number) might have embedded meaning about the product
- preserve this code in its entirety
	- as well as break down into its component parts
