## Variables
- programs(including shell scripts) work with site-specific data
- in order to provide site-specific data - > variables are used
- using variables allows an OS to keep program code generic - > allows portability, separate site specific info
	- decoupling
	- makes them portable
- linux OS itself comes with variables
- env command - > to print list of these env vars
- to define a var - > key=value
- by default variables will only be available in current shell only
- to define a variable for current shell and all subshells -> export key=value
- to make sure a variable is automatically set, put it in one of the bash startup files(bash profile)
- refer to a variable using $key
- to avoid ambiguity use ${name of the variable}
	- ex: echo ${key}1 - > prints value of var key followed by 1, echo ${key1} - > prints value of key1 var

## alias
- bash internal command that allows us to define our own command
- type alias in shell to get a list of current aliases
- usually aliases defined in bashrc
- use aliases in shell scripts only if we define it in the shell scripts
	- ex: alias sander='man useradd'
	- unalias sander

## Using bash startup files
- bash startup files are used to provide default settings for the operating system env
- these startup files are shell scripts themselves
- /etc/profile is a generic startup file that is started for every login shell
	- shell that is opened when a user is logging in
	- /etc/profile - > system-wide file
	- login shell: shell that is opened to initialize the user env upon login
- /etc/bashrc is a generic startup file that is started when opening a subshell
	- subshell opened when a command is executed
	- every command that is executed in linux starts it's own subshell
	- the command then works with this proprietary env
- user specific files:
	- ~/.bash_profile
	- ~/.bashrc

## Understanding Alternative shells
- bash: based on shell created back in 1970s
- bourne shell was the original shell
- UNIX written in C programming lang
	- Cshell was created which was very close to C prog lang
	- more features than bourne shell
	- complicated
- Korne Shell (/bin/ksh) was created as a shell that offers the best of Bourne and C-shell
	- it was not opensource
- Bourne Again Shell - > remake of the Bourne shell
- all the other common linux shells are a fork of bourne shell
- another common shell is Zsh which is useed as the default shell on MacOs
	- little better than Bash
- Dash - > used frequently in Debian

## Understanding Exit codes
- after execution, a command generates an exit code
- meaning of the exit code is to convey to the parent shell - > how successful the command was
- the last exit code generated can be requested using **echo $?**
- if 0 - > command was executed successfully
- 1 - > generic error
- the developer of a program can decide to code other exit codes as well
- anything other than zero means - > there was some issue
- in shell scripts, this is done by using **exit n** in case error condition occurs

## Shell Script
- a shell script is a computer program designed to run in a shell
- scripts can be written in diff scripting langs
- typical fns are file manipulation, program executing and printing text
