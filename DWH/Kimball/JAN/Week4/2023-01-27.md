## Dimension Surrogate Keys
- The PK of dim cannot be the operational sys's natural key
	- if it is the case, there will be multiple rows for the same natural key in the dim
		- why? to track the changes it goes through
		- will affect the records in fact that already have a FK assigned
- especially when integrating data from multiple sys, it becomes difficult to take one natural key
- Dim surrogate key - simple int
	- typically starting from 1
	- in sequence
	- exceptions are there
		- calendar dim

## Natural, Durable and SuperNatural keys
- NK:
	- created by OSS
	- subject to business rules
		- if the emp resigns and is then rehired later, he cannot have the same emp key
- when the DW/BI wants only one key for that emp -> DK
- DK
	- durable
	- does not change or become invalid in any situation
	- sometimes refered to as Durable Supernatural K
	- Best DK have format that is independent of the original business process
	- the emp will always have only one DK associated

## Degenerate dimensions:
- common with  [[2023-01-24#Accummulating Snapshot fact tables]], [[2023-01-23#Txn fact tables]]
- invoice key

## Multiple hierarchies in Dimensions
- many dims have more than one natural hierarchies
	- ex: calendar data dim may have 
		- day to week to month to year hierarchy
- allowed
## Flags and indicators as Textual attr
- abbreviations, True/False fields should be supplemented with clear textual desciptions

## Null attr in dims:
- happens when a given dim row is not populated fully
- or when an attr does not apply to all rows
- in those cases, substitue null with NA or Unknown
- should be avoided
	- diff dbs handle grouping and constraining on nulls inconsistently

## Calendar date dims
- attached to almost all fact tables
- allows navigation of the fact table through familiar date, months etc
- has cols that describe :
	- week no.
	- month name
	- fiscal period
	- national holiday indicator
- pk usually = YYYYMMDD
- need a special row to describe unknown or yet to be determined dates
