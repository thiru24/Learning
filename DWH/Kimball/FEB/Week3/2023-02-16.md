## Numeric values as Attr or facts
- if value is mainly used for filtering and grouping - > dim attr
- if used in calculations - > facts
- ex: unit prices
- sometimes both -> fact and dim attr

## Drilling down on dimensions attrs
- a reasonable num of dim attrs - > 50 descriptive
- each attr source of constraining and constructing row header labels
- drilling down: adding row header attrs to reports from dim tables
- drilling up: removing row headers from reports
- as we drill down the information is very specific

- higher the number of descriptive dim attrs higher capability to analyze 
## Store dimension
- describes every store in the grocery chain
- unlike product master files, there might not be comprehensive store master files
- pos sys might simply provide only the store number on the txn records
- in these cases, project teams should assemble data related to store dim from multiple operational sources
## Multiple hierarchies in Dim tables
- store dim is the primary geographic dim in the retail case
- each store can be thought of as a location
- each store can be rolled up to any geograhpic attr
	- zip code
	- district
	- state
- stores likely roll up an internal hierarchies such as 
	- store districts and regions
- so stores can have at the least two hierarchies:
	- internal
	- geographic

- floor plan type, photo processing type, financial service types - > should be full descritption and not codes
- square footages are constant for the stores and are additive across stores

## Dates within dimension tables
- in the above dim first open date and last remodel dates can be of type date
- but also if there is a need for business that indicates these columns will be analyzed in a non-standard way - > then these columns are join keys to copies of the date dim tables
- the date dim copies are views 
- the copies are semantically different from the primary date dims

- this is a permissable outrigger dim
- the column names are relabeled to make sure there is no cofusion with the columns from the primary date dimension
- these distinct logical views on a single physical date dim are an example of role playing dimensions
