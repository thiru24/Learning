## Understanding the role of bash
- bash is a shell
- shell if part of OS
- Shell interprets commands and translates them to machine code
- this machine code is executed by the kernel
- Kernel inaccessible to humans
- Computer OS can use either a CLI or GUI as shell
- GUI only offer a subset of fnality that the CLI offers

## Using STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR and I/O redirection
- std input is where commands are typed
- std output is where commands send their result by default
- std error is where commands send their error messages
- the computer keyboard is the default STDIN, the computer monitor is the default STDOUT for most programs
- as a shell user, we can redefine what to use as STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR by using redirection

### File Descriptors
- in UNIX and LINUX, a file descriptor is a unique handle for a file
- file descriptors are also used for input and output, (including STDIN(0), STDERR(2),STDOUT(1)) and pipes and sockets
- when we open a file, the OS creates an entry to represent that file
	- used to store information about that opened file
- the entries are made in the kernel
- entries represented by integers
- this entry number is file descriptor
- file descriptor: unique integer number that uniquely represents an opened file for processes
- similarly there are socket descriptors
- file descriptor can be dynamically assigned or explicitly assigned by operator
- file descriptor visible through -> /proc/PID/fd

### Redirection
- allows to send STDOUT and STDERR to a file, and obtain STDIN from a file
- using STDIN from a file is uncommon
- > = STDOUT redirection, overwrites
- >> = STDOUT redirection, appends
- /dev/null - > special device, everything we redirect here is discarded
- 2> = STDERR redirection
- proc dir - > all about kernel

### Pipe
- special case of redirection
- applied to use the STDOUT of the first command as STDIN of the second command

## Using Internal commands
- external commands: part of the os which are installed in disk 
	- so the first time we need to access an external command - > access from disk
	- many cases we might need to load libraries(dependencies) with these commands
- to provide core functionality -> internal commands
	- part of the bash shell binaries
	- do not have to be loaded from disk
	- already in memory
	- faster than using external
- type help and enter
	- to get a list of all internal commands
	- **help internal_command** - > will display help on that command
- man bash - > to see all internal commands
