### Dimensional Modeling:
- widely accepted and preffered technique to present analytic data
- why? because it satisfies two requirements:
	1. Deliver data that can be understood by the users
	2. deliver fast query performance
- longstanding technique to make dbs simple
- Dimensional modeling is different from third normal form
	[[Normalization]]:
	- process of organizing the data of a database
	- this process helps us minimize the redundancy of the data
	- helps us eliminate several anamolies
- 3NF structures divide data into many discrete entities as tables
- a sale can start as a single record but can turn into complex spider web diagram as a 3NF model
- 3NF models sometimes refered to as Entity Relationship models
- Entity Relationship Diagrams are drawings that communicate relationship b/w tables
- both 3NF and Dim Models can be represented using ERD because both consist of joined relational tables
- key diff b/w 3NF and dim models is the degree of normalization
- 3NF structures are very useful in operational processing
	- because an update/insert transaction touches the db in one place (because there will be redundancy)
- normalized models are not suitable for BI queries
	- users might find it difficult to remeber/understand normalized models
- querying a normalized model is inefficient as well
- the use of normalized model is against the requirements of DW/BI system
- dim model contains the same info as normalized model but packages data in a different format suitable for ^407b91
	- understandability
	- query performance
	- flexibile to change
