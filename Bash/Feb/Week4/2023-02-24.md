## echo
- bash internal command
- diff options are supported to manage special chars
- to use formatting options, use echo -e and put the string b/w double quotes
	- \\b is backspace : echo -e "b\\bc"
	- \\n is newline : echo -e "b\\nc"
	- \\t is tab: echo -e "b\\tc"
- alternative : Cshel (some features here do not have equivalents in echo)

## printf
- used to print text on screen
- has more formatting options than echo
- does not print a new line char after o/p by default
![[Pasted image 20230224165445.png]]- 
- use printf "%s\\n""hello world"
	- %s format string - >applied to all args used with printf

- space is the default inferred field delimiter by printf
	 ![[Pasted image 20230224165807.png]]
	- in the above example space is inferred as field delimiter and formatting is applied, which is new line in this case

### Using printf formatting strings
- "%s" is used to identify the argumets as strings
- "%d" is used to identify the arguments as digits/integers
- "%f" is used to identify the arguments as floats
- while using formatting strings further specifiers can be used:
	- printf "%f\\n" 255
	- printf "%.1f\\n" 255
	- for i in \$( seq 1 10); do printf "%04d\\t" "$i"; done
		- zero padded 4 digit integer followed by tab

- normal, hexa and octal interpreted as digits and floats

## Bash options
- bash shell can be configured with additional options, using **set**
	1. set -x
	2. ls 
	3. set +x
![[Pasted image 20230224172413.png]] Displays the actual command that was executed(not the alias)

- use set in a terminal to set standard behaviour
- in shell scripts we can specify options in shebang statment as well, so that only for the scripts settings are changed
	- #!/bin/bash -x
- additional options can be configured from a script using **shopt**
	- ex: shopt +s extglob - > extended globbing patterns
	- execute below
	1. shopt -s checkjobs
	2. sleep 3600 &
	3. exit

Reminds us about running BG jobs
- type shopt without args to display available options
- check **man bash** - > to view all about the shopt options
