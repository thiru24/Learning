## Degenerate dim surrogate keys
- in this case txn number was used as degenerate dim
- if the case is:
	- txn number is not unique across store locations
	- or they wrap back to 0 and reuse previous numbers
- create a dim with a surrogate key and natural key
- this also saves us from repeating bulky txn numbers in facts
- no longer degenerate

## Date dim smart keys
- more common pk of date dim -> yyyymmdd
	- should not be used as an alternate to date dim
	- if used for filtering and grouping - > bad for performance
	- useful in partitioning fact tables
	- provides adv of being both the SK and easier partition candidate
- if integer keys are used, start with 1 for the first date in the date dim
- some relational db optimizers **prefer** a true date type column for partitioning
	- in that case SK - date type
	- the optimizer knows there are 31 values between March 1 and April 1, as opposed to the apparent 100 values between 20130301 and 20130401. Likewise, it understands there are 31 values between December 1 and January 1, as opposed to the 8,900 integer values between 20121201 and 20130101.
	- this might impact the query strategy used by optimizer
		- and that can even improve performance 

## Fact table surrogate keys
- not necessary for a fact table
- only makes sense for back room ETL processing
- typically PK of Fact tables -> subset of table's FK and degenerate dim key
- single col SK for facts have some back room benefits
	- very unlikely to provide performance adv

### Adv of fact table surrogate keys
- immediate unique identification of each fact row
	- we do not have to navigate multiple dims to find the rows
- backing out or resuming a bulk load
	- as tracker for incomplete load jobs
- Replacing updates with inserts plus deletes
	- useful when we have to update a fact row
	- place a new row with new surrogate key and a few update fields
	- delete the old row with old SK
	- efficient than updates for large set of rows
- using fact table SK as a parent in a parent/child schema
	- cases where one **fact table** contains rows that are parents of those in a lower grain fact table
	- the SK of the parent Fact table are exposed in the child table as well
	- using SK instead of NK offers more consistency as they do not change
