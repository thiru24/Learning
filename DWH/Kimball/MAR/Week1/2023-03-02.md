- a default SK is used in date columns for which we do not know the value for in Acc SS

## Lags b/w milestones and milestone counts
- sometimes lag metrics is simple diff b/w milestones dates, date/timestamps 
- in other situations lag calculation made more complex by only considering business days etc..
- sometimes these tables use milestone completion counters -> either 0 or 1
- often we have a FK column to status dim which is updated to reflect pipeline's latest status

## Accumulating snapshot updates and OLAP cubes
- ACSS reflect the most current status and metrics
- do not accommodate complex scenarios that occur infrequently
	- the analysis of the outlier can be done with txn ft
- ACSS problematic for OLAP cubes
	- because ACSS forces both facts and dim FK to change
		- much of the cube might need reprocessing due to the updates
		- obviously this does not apply if the row is loaded only after all milestones are completed

## Complementary Fact table types
- sometimes ACSS and PSS work together
- PSS might be built from ACSS, period: monthly
- when deploying two fact tables on the same BP, there will be some redundacy
	- but important aspect of this deployment is different vantage points
## Value chain integration
- Business management might want to look across BPs to evaluate performances
- using shared common dims is absolutely critical to designing dim models that can be integrated

## Enterprise DWH bus arch
- building the enterprise's DW/BI in one single effort - > very hard
	- buillding it in isolated pieces -> against our goal of integration
- for long term DW/BI success, we need to use an architected, incremental approach to build enterprise's DWH
	- that approach is EDWHBA

## Understanding the bus architecture
- bus is a common structure to which everything connects and from which everything derives its power
- the bus in a computer is a std i/f specification
	- that helps us to plug in devices
	- because of the computer's bus std, devices are able to work together and coexist, even though they might be manufactured at diff times by diff people
- by defining the standard bus interface for the DW/BI env, separate dim models can be implemented by diff groups at diff times and can coexist
- ultimately all processes of an org's value chain create a family of DMs that share common, conformed dims

- bus arch independent of tech and db platform
- all flavours of relational and OLAP based dim models can be full participants in the EDWBA if they are designed around conformed dimension and facts
- DW/BI sys inevitably consist of separate machines with diff OS and DBMS
	- united by arch of conformed dims and facts
