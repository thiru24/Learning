## Periodic Snapshot Fact tables
- a row in this table summarizes many measurement events across a standard period
- grain is the period, not the individual txn
- even if no activity during the period, null or zero record inserted (ex:for product)

## Accummulating Snapshot fact tables
- a row in this table summarizes measurement events happening at predictable steps b/w the begining and the end of a process
	- ex: order fulfilment, claim processing
	- defined start point and standard intermediate steps and defined end point
	- processes with above description can be modeled using Accumulating Snapshot fact tables
- date FK present for each critical milestone in the process
- a row is created when an order is placed
- updated as steps/milestones acheived
- contains FK for other dims and optionally some degenerate keys

## Factless fact tables
- possible that an event only records set of dimensional entities
	- ex: student attending the class
		- fact row with foreign keys for calendar day, student, teacher, location, class is defined
		- no numerical measurement
- can be used to analyze what happened and what did not happen

## Aggregate fact tables or OLAP Cubes
- table that is generated by agging atomic fact tables
- to boost performance of common queries
- should be available to the BI layer at the same time as atomic facts
	- BI will choose appropriate agg level based on query
	- this process is aggregate navigation
- agg fact tables contains FKs to shrunken conformed dimensions
- agg OLAP cubes with summarized measurements are built in the same way as relational aggs
- OLAP cubes are meant to be accessed by business users(BU)

## Consolidated fact tables
- facts from multiple processes consolidated together
	-  if they can be expressed in the same grain
	- ex: sales actuals can be consolidated with forecasts in a single fact tables
	- makes it easier to analyze forecasts v actuals
	- forecasts_actuals_fact table priceline
- adds burden to ETL sys
- decreases the burden on BI apps

# Basic dim techs:

## Dim table structure:
- single PK col
	- embedded as a FK in a associated fact table
- wide, flat, denormalized
- many low cardinality text attr(less in number, unique)
- most powerful = most verbose attr
- target of filtering and grouping
- descriptive labels on reports are typically dim attr values
