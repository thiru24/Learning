## Independent Data Mart Architecture:

- analytical data deployed on a departmental basis
- no concern of integrating info across the enteprise
- department identifies requirements for data from an operational source system
- dept works with IT and outside staffs to construct a db 
- this departmental dm addresses department's analytical requirements
- it is common for multiple departments to be interested in the same performance metric resulting from an org's core business events
- departments construct their own structures even if they are similar/identical data(slightly diff).
- chances of inconsistency is high when the departments get to gether to discuss enterprise wide performance(labels, business rules might be diff)

- analytic silos
- no cross organizational [[data governance]] or coordination
- short term : fast dev, low cost
- long term downsides: multiple uncoordinated extracts from the same source, redundant storage
- multiple sources of truths, multiple view points - > leads to more debate
- no conformed dims
- implements dim modeling(simple data, faster queries)

- data aquisition is where the etl systems do their work
- the atomic data that results from DA ends up in a 3NF DB ~ Enterprise DWH
- normalized EDWH is mandatory in CIF arch
- advocates enterprise data coordination and integration
- CIF suggests normalization addresses integration
- normalization != integration
- Separate incompatible database sources can be normalized to the hilt without addressing integration.
- integration : resolve data inconsistencies without explicity requiring normalizations
- EDWH has the most timely info
- but the data is eventually delivered to downstream sys
	- department centric not business process centric
	- agged data
- data delivery also etl process that make data ready for downstream sys -> summarizes data
	- avoid re labeling
	- will become diff to tie back to EDW
