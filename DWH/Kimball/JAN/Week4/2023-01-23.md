## Basic fact table technique
- tech that apply to all fact tables

### Fact table structure
- fact table contains numeric measures produced by an operational measurement event in the real world
- at the lowest grain, fact table row = measurement event
- contains FKs , optional timestamps and degenerate dimension keys
	- degenerate dimension keys: dim key in a fact table for which there is no dim table
- primary target for computation and dynamic aggregation

### Non- , semi, fully additive facts
- fully additive: most felxible, useful.
	- which can be summed across any dimension
- semi: summed across some dims
	- balance amts, can be summed across all dims except time
- non: cannot be summed across any dims
	- ratios
	- try to store the fully additive components of the non additive measure

### Null in fact tables
- not a problem at all if present in the measurement columns
	- all the agg functions can deal with null effectively
- must be avoided in the FK columns
	- will cause referential integrity violation
- instead of null in FK, have a default row(and surrogate key) in dim representing unknown values

#### surrogate key:
- is a PK
- have no business significance, only to be an unique identifier of a row
- either generated by the DB or by another app
- artificial or identity key
- no semantic meaning

### Conformed facts:
- same measurements can appear in diff fact tables
- these facts can be compared or computed together is their technical definitions are identical
- if the definitions are consistent - > conformed facts
	- should be named identical
- if not name diff

### Txn fact tables
- a row in txn fact table represents a measurement event at a point in space and time
- atomic txn grain fact - > most dimensional, expressive fact tables
- may be dense or sparse
	- rows exist only if measurement takes place
- always contain FK
- optional timestamp, degenerate dim keys
