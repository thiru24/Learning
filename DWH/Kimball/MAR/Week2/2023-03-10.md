## Importance of Data Governance and Stewardship
- key challenge:
	- reaching enterprise consensus on dim attrr names and contents
- in many orgs, business rules and data def have traditionally been established departmentally
	- the consequence of this lack of data governance and control are prevalent deptmental data silos
		- these silos provide slightly diff versions of truth
### Business-driven Governance
- subject matter experts from the business need to lead this initiative

### Governance Objectives
- key objective is to reach agreement on:
	- data definitions
	- data labels
	- domain values
- if the above is not agreed:
	- same word may describe diff things
	- diff words describe the same thing
	- same value may have diff meaning
- DG fn also establishes policies and responsibilities for:
	- data quality and accuracy
	- data security and access control

### Conformed dims and the Agile movement
- CD enable agile DW/BI dev
	- along with agile decision making
- CD allow a dim table to be built and maintained once rather than recreating slightly diff versions in each dev cycle
- reusing conformed dims across projects is where we get the leverage for more agile DW/BI dev
- time-to-market for a new BP data source shrinks as dev reuse existing conformed dims
- new ETL development focuses almost exclusively on delivering more FT
- not necessary to get consensus on every attr in every dim
- select a subset of attr that have significance across the enterprise
- the subset of dims can then be expanded by adding attr

## Conformed Facts
- 95% of effor is establishing conformed dims
	- rest is for CF
- Revenue, profit, standard prices and costs, measures of quality and customer satisfaction and other KPI are facts that must conform
- if these facts live in more than one dim model and are called the same:
	- the underlying def and equations for these facts must be the same
- if a FT has attr on a specific unit and the other FT with another unit, we should not let the BU convert either of the unit to other using conversion factors
	- the FT should carry atrs with both units
