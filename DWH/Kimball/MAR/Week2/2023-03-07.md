## Retrofitting existing models to a bus matrix
- if we are not starting from scratch and if there are already some dim models that are built without following the conformed dim arch
- understand the gap bw current env with the org's architected goal
	- dev an inc plan to convert standalone dim model to enterprise arch
- if the existing dim models are satisfactory
	- dims need to be rebuilt using a cross-reference map ![[DWH/Kimball/Feb/Week4/2023-02-22#^557904]]
	- fact tables might need to be reprocessed to replace the original dim keys with the comformed dim keys
	- if the original and conformed dim has diff attr, rework existing BI apps and queries
- not having conformed dims is not the only problems
- sometimes the grain might not be granular
- in many of the other issues than conformity, it is better to start from scratch
## Conformed Dims
- many names:
	- common dims
	- master dims
	- reference dims
- should be built only once in the ETL sys
	- then replicate it either logically or physically throughout the enterprise
### Drilling across Fact tables
- conformed dims adv:
	- consistency
	- reusability
	- combine performance measurements from diff BP in a single report
- use multipass SQL to query each dim model separately
	- then outer join the query results based on a common dim attr
- this is called drill acorss
	- straightforward if the dim table attr values are identical across dim models
- supported by many BI products and platforms
	- implementation diff on where the results are joined:
		- app server
		- report
		- temp tables(db)
- any cross fact calculations must be done in BI app after the separate conformed results are returned
- below example: oreder facts ,inventory fact, sales facts

## Identical Conformed Dims
- at most low level, conformed dims means the same thing with every FT to which they are joined.
	- ex: date dim
- identical CD have consistent:
	- dim keys
	- attr column names
	- attr  definitions
	- attr values
		- hence grouping will be consistent
- dim attrs do not conform if names diff
- may be the same physical table within the db
- if many dbs are used, built once replicated everywhere
- same num of rows, keys, attr labels, attr data def, atr values across dim models
- sometimes dims at the same level of granularity do not fully conform
	- ex: product and store attr needed for inventory analysis in the 
		- not appropriate for retail sales
		- these attrs cannot be used for drill across
		- but the dims will be conforming if the common columns are identical
