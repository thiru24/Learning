## Separating code from site specific data
- code not including site specific info - > decoupling
- to implement decoupling in shell scripts, variables should be defined in separate files that are used by "sourcing"(including) them in the main script
- when a file is sourced, the contents of that file is included in the current shell, without starting a subshell

### using source
- when sourcing variables the files to be sourced should be stored separately
- some linux distros are doing this by using an etc/sysconfig dir
- to source a script, two approaches exist:
	- source myvars 
	- . myvars (dot is a command in this line)
	- will source the file
- in previous versions of linux, **init** was used to start services
- if a script is being sourced, the sourced script does not need a shebang statement
	- because then it will start a subshell
	- we do not want that because we need the vars in the current shell
	- even functions can be sourced
		- refrain
- here the source command's arg is relative path
- try to keep it abs path because it is more understandable for us when we look at the script later

## Viewing current variables
- variables can be set in diff ways
- viewing all currently defined variables is not easy
- **set** shows all current vars, including functions and the values of the variables
- **compgen -v** will show variables only and not their values
	- compgen is the command about bash completion
	- allows us to investigate items on which bash completion can be used
- the variables we have defined do not appear in the **env** command's o/p

## Handling script args
- the first argument is stored in $1
	- second arg stored in $2 and so on
	- script name is stored in $0
- values of these vars cannot be changed within the script
- by default, a max of nine arguments can be defined this way
- when using curly braces, more than nine arguments can be provided
	- depends on the shell as well
- script arguments can be addressed individually
- to address all arguments use $@ or $*
- without quotes $@ and $* are identical
- with quotes, $@ expands to properly quoted arguments, and $* makes all arguments into a single arg
- $* -> useful when we want to put the args to array
- shift command to throw away(discard) first arg

- in the above scripts we must know how many args are present
- $# prints the number of args
