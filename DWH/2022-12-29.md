### DWH :

- is a informational environment that:
      1. Provides integrated centralized view of an organization.
      2. makes historical and incremental data easily accessible
      3. isolates analytical workloads from the operational systems
      4. leads to consistent analytics.
      5. provides interactive source of SI.

- no generation of new data
- use of the large volumes of existing data as a base
- exists to answer questions about:
	 1. performance of various business operations
	 2. business trends

- due to DWH, business users get direct access to data.
- DWH is a environment, **not** a product(s/w or h/w).
- computing environment.

- basic functions of DWH:
	 1. extract all the data from operational systems
	 2. where necessary, add relevant information from outside.(such as industry benchmark metrics)
	 3. integrate all data from various sources
	 4. remove inconsistencies, redundancies and transform the data.
	 5. store the data in a format suitable for easy access
- not one technological solution for all the functions above:

- many vendors started offering h/w and s/w products to support different fns within the DWH env
- data stored in dwh may be channeled to datamarts for specific users
- once dwh was introduced there were intial road blocks that were solved by shifts from the original implementation. 
- some of the road blocks were:
	 1. Government deregularization increased the competition
	 2. new privacy regulations demanded a review of methods of data collection and its use
	 3. self service tools provided to users were complex
- these challenges forced companies to take a second look at their dwh envs.
- revised goals of Decision Support Systems:
	 1. transformation of data into information
	 2. derivation of knowledge from information
- business intelligence for an organization requires two environments:
	 1. transformation of data into info
	 2. transformation of info into knowledge

### Business Intelligence:

- two fold description:
	 1. systems and tech for gathering, cleansing, consolidating and storing corporate data.
	 2.  tools and tech to analyze the stored data
