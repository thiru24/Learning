## Promotion Dim:
- describes promotion condition under which the product is sold
- promotion conditions include:
	- temp price reductions
	- end aisle diplay
	- newspaper ads
	- coupons
- often called causal dimension
	- because these describe factors that cause a change in the product sales
- BA are interested in judging whether a promotion is effective
- judged on one or more of the following factors:
	- whether the products under promotion experienced a gain in sales: *lift*.
		- lift can be measured only if there is a baseline
		- baseline should be agreed upon, either based on historic sales or with the help of sophisticated models
	- whether the product under promotion showed a dip in sales right **before** or **after** the promotion, cancelling the gain in the sales during the promotion
		- called time shifting
		- did we transfer sales from regularly priced products to temporarily reduced prices
	- whether the products under promotion showed a gain in sales but the other products nearby on the shelf showed a corresponding sales decrease (cannibalization)
	- whether all the products in the promoted category of products showed a net overall gain in sales taking into account the time before, during and after the promotion(market growth)
	- whether the promotion was profitable
		- profit of promotion = gain over the baseline sales taking into account timeshifting and cannibalization, cost of the promotion
	- the causal conditions might not be directly tracked by POS sys
		- POS tracks
			- reduced prices
			- presence of coupons(if the customer produces it)
		- ads and instore displays may need to be traced from other sources
- the various causal conditions are highly correlated
	- A temporary price reduction usually is associated with an ad and perhaps an end aisle display
- this reason demands a new row to be created in the promotion dim for each combination of promotion conditions that occur
- For example, in a given promotion, most of the stores would run all three(first three) promotion mechanisms simultaneously, but a few of the stores may not deploy the end aisle displays. In this case, two separate promotion condition rows would be needed, one for the normal price reduction plus ad plus display and one for the price reduction plus ad only
- we can decide to move the causal mechanisms (price_red,ads,display and coupons) to another dim rather than combining them in to one
- why we could keep the four dims together
	- if the four causal mech are highly correlated the combined single dim is not much larger than any one of the separated dimensions would be
	- the combined single dim can be used to browse and understand how the mechanisms are used together
		- this browsing only shows the possible promotion combinations
		- data related to how business was affected can be found only in fact table

- why we could separate into four dims
	- can be more understandable to business if they think each one as a separate entity
	- if they think it may be better to manage as single entities
- the content in both cases will be the same
- the promotion cost could be used for constraining
- should not appear in fact
	- wrong grain
	- can be in a fact table whose grain is : overall promotion
