## Dimension Tables
- companions to fact tables
- contains textual context associated with the business measurement event
- data in this would answers questions like: "why? what? how? where? when? who?"
- dimension tables often have many columns
	- ex: 50,100
- fewer rows than fact
- each dim defined by a single PK
	- which serves as the basis for [[referential integrity]] with any given fact table to which it is joined
- dim attributes are primary candidates for filters and grouping
- dim attributes crucial to making DW/BI understandable
	- contains real words than cryptic abbreviations
- minimize use of codes in dim tables
- strive to use more verbose textual attributes
- some cases these code might be unavoidable, it is fine to persist then
- sometimes operational codes might come with embedded info
	- ex: first two digits - region, second two digits - product line(ex:stationary) etc..
	- instead of forcing users to query on the substring level, separate this one attribute to a necessary number and make n number of attributes
- the DWH is only as good as the dimension attributes
	- the analytical power of the DW/BI env is directly proportional to the quality and depth of the dimension attributes
- sometimes there might be a confusion whether a numeric data element, from an operational source data,  is a fact or dimension attribute
- fact - takes on lot of values, participates in calculations
- dim attribute - discretely valued description, more or less unchanging, participates in constrains (ex: product id, product group)
- product cost - might seem like a constant attr but if in our case it will go through changes alot then fact
- a data element can be classified both ways
- one golden rule:
	- continuously valued numeric observations ~ facts
	- discrete numeric observations drawn from a small list ~ dim attr
- dim example:

- important to note that instead of having separate lookup tables for brand and category, the designer chose to have the names in the same dim - > increases query performance
- storage optimization for dims can be skipped as dims are relatively smaller than facts and virtually has no impact in the db size
- the accessibility is increased by choosing not to normalize
- dim tables are highly denormalized with many to one relationship, 1 product -> brand name same products maps to a category
