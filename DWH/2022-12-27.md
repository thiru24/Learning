- All the past attempts to provide strategic information were inefficient.

- Some reasons for the above:
                1. Too many requests. With limited resources IT were not able to service each request within a stipulated time.
                2. One report cannot answer all the questions. So this increases the variety of requests.
                3. Users started requesting all possible combination of reports so that they do not have place individual requests.

- One of the fundamental reason for inability and inefficiency in providing SI in a timely manner:
         -  SI was being provided from the Operational Systems

 1. What are operational systems? 
 2. Why are Operational Systems not suitable to produce SI?

### Operational Systems:

-  are Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems
- makes the wheel of business turn
- called the bread-and-butter-systems
- Support basic business processes
- These systems get the data into the database.
- Each transaction processes information about a single entity(order, customer).

### Decision Support Systems:

- specially designed and built.
- not meant to run core business processes
- Used to watch the business run.
- Decision Support systems are designed to get SI out of the DBs.

| Criteria         | Operational            | Informational                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Data Content     | Current Values         | Archived,derived,summarised   |
| Data Structure   | Optimized for Txn      | Optimized for complex queries |
| Access frequency | High                   | Medium to Low                 |
| Access Type      | Read, Update, Delete   | Read                          |
| Usage            | Predictable,repetitive | Random, Ad-hoc and Heuristic  |
| Response Time    | Seconds                | minutes/seconds               |
| Users            | Large                  | Small                              |


**Desired features of a system that provides SI:**

- DB designed for analytical task
- various data sources
- easy to use and supports long interactive sessions by users
- read intensive data usage
- Direct interactions without the support of IT teams.
- Up-to-date data.
- Historical data storage as well

**Processing requirements of the system:** Ability to process any amount data.

- These led to the creation of DWH envs. 
- Kept separate from the operational env

- In b/w operational sys and DWH there is a data staging area.
- Data is cleansed and transformed into a suitable format.
