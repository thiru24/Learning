# Resisting Normalizing urges

## Snowflake schemas with Normalized Dims
- dim table normalization is called as snowflaking
- normalization of the product dim:
 ![[Pasted image 20230224153225.png]]
 - too many new dims just from one primary dim
 - this causes many problems:
	 - complex presentation
		 - BUs struggle with this complexity 
		 - simplicity main objective of dim model
	- db optimizers struggle
		- when dealing with snowflaked dims
		- numerous table joins - > slower query performance 
	- when we try to save space in dims by normalization - > usually insignificant
		- If you replace the 20-byte department description in the 300,000 row product dimension table with a 2-byte code, youâ€™d save a whopping 5.4 MB (300,000 x 18 bytes); meanwhile, you may have a 10 GB fact table!
	- query gets bigger and complex
		- when we want details only about an entity this would be helpful
		- but BU are more interested about many factors at the same time
	- snowflaking defeats the purpose of bitmap indexing
		- bitmap indexing useful when using low cardinality columns
		- they improve the performance of a query or constraint on that specific column
- fixed depth hierarchies should be flattened in dim tables
- snowflake dim tables penalize cross-atribute browsing (relationship related)
- disk space saving achieved by normalizing is less than 1% of the total disk space needed for the whole schema
	- this one percent becomes even more eligible when we consider the performance gain we get with de normalized data
- some db vendors argue that their platform accommodates normalized dim model with great performance
	- then it is fine as long as it does not become complicated for the BU
- some BI tools indicated a preference for Snowflaked schemas - > then go for normalization
- if all the data is delivered to users via an OLAP cube (where the snowflaked dim which is used to populate the cube are not visible to the users) - > go ahead
- but in all the "go ahead" cases, we might also have to consider forward compatibility 
	- will we change BI tool

## Outriggers
- permissible in some cases
- in retail: ![[2023-02-16#Dates within dimension tables]]
- outriggers introduce more joins -> bad
- we have to make sure the std date dim that we use to create this new dim are compatible
	- meaning the dates we require are present in the dim
- used when BU want to filter and group dates in non standard
