# CH5 Procurement
- procurement involves multiple activities:
	- negotiating contracts
	- issuing purchase requisition
	- purchase orders
	- tracking receipts
	- authorizing payments

## Procurement txn and Bus matrix
- procurement has diff types of txns
- grain: one row / procurement txn
- dims:
	- txn date
	- product
	- vendor
	- contract terms
	- procurement txn type
- facts:
	- procurement txn quantity
	- dollar amount

## Single vs Multiple Txn FT
- to the business, purchase orders, shipping notices, warehouse receipts, vendor payments are all viewed as separate unique processes
- several of procurement processes come from diff source sys
- diff txn types in procurement have diff dimensionality
	- ex: discount taken applies to vendor payments but not to other txn types
- there are control numbers for these diff txns:
	- purchase order numbers
	- payment check numbers
	- these control numbers are perfect candidates for DD
	- for certain txns more than one control number may apply
- we have two choices:
	- make one FT with Txn type dim to view all types of txn in one FT
	- build separate FT for each Txn type
- we can choose one of the above based on:
	- business requirements
	- realities of underlying source data
- detailed BM

- multiple FTs enable richer and more descriptive dims and attrs
	- ex: purchase order date and receipt date would likely have been generalized to txn date if a single fact table was considered

## Complementary procurement snapshot
- accumulating ss that crosses processes is complementary to txn tables
- helps in monitoring product movement as it proceeds through the procurement pipeline
- we can build this table only if there are well defined milestones

## SCD basics
- dim modelers to work with business data governance team to decide on change-handling strategy
- for each dim attr specify change-handling strategy
- SCD is nothing but:
	- when an attr changes in the operational world how will the dim model react
