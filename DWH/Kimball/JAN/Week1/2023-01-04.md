- asset of an org -> information
- ussed for two purposes:
	 1. operational record keeping
	 2. analytical decision making

- operational systems are where we put the data in
- DW/BI system is where we get the data out
- operational systems almost always deal with one txn record at a time
- OpS does same tasks over and over again, executing the orgs business process
- OpS does not maintain history

### Goals of DW/BI:
- DW/BI system must make info easily accessible
	 1. contents are understandable to the business user and not just the developer
	 2. BI tools and apps that access the tools must be simple and easy to use
	 3. Simple and fast
- DW/BI system must present information consistently
	1. Data must be credible
	2. carefully assembled from a variety of sources
	3. consistent in names, types
		1. if two entities have the same name, they must be the same things
- Adapt to change based on 
		1. user needs
		2. business condition
		3. data
		4. tech
	- should manage change without disturbing existing systems and processes
- Present info in a timely way 
		 - within hours minutes or seconds, raw data must be converted into actionable form
		 - DW/BI teams, business users must have realistic expectations
-  must be secure with controlled access
-  must act as a trustworthy and authoritative foundation for improved decision making
- must be acceptable by the community
