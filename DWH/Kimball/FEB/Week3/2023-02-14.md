- try not to store ratios and percentage in fact table
- unit price is a non additive fact
	- but mandatory one

## Txnal fact table
- fact tables representing txnal processes have common characteristic
	- the grain of the atomic txn line can be explained in terms of the txn that happened
		- ex: one row per txn or one row per line item in txn
	- often sparsely populated
		- store will not sell every product in every shopping cart
	- even though sparsely populated, they are huge
	- tend to be highly dimensional
	- metrics resulting from txnal fact tables are highly additive
		- in this case we must make sure to include extended quantity price, unit price alone is not  enough
- it is often helpful to estimate the size of the largest table
	- in this case, talk with the source system expert to understand how many txn line items are produced in a periodic basis
	- alternate way to estimate the num rows is: total revenue of the chain of stores/average unit cost of products

## Dimension table details

### date dim
- one dim that is guaranteed to be part of almost all dim models
	- every business process captures a timestamp
- first dimension to be considered in the partitioning scheme of the db
- can be built in advance
	-  put 10 to 20 years of rows representing individual days
- recommended partial list of columns for a daily date dim table

- day of the week column - day name(wednesday)

- one frequent arg: 
	- why have a separate date dim? can have date key colum, of date type, in the fact table and constrain directly in any way needed to avoid the join.
	- but we have alot of drawbacks
		- business user not versed in sql
		- db date funcs do not provide quarter, weekday,holiday indicators - > context missing
	- date dim especially useful when we expect the business to slice data based on non standard date attrs

## Flags and Indicators as Textual attr
- ex: holiday indicator in date dim
	- two values accepted: holiday or non-holiday
- these attr's values should not be True/False,0/1,Y/N - > cryptic
- these attr serve as report labels
	- so if these attr are much more descriptive, reports will be self-explanatory
- later we do not have to decode the cryptic values
