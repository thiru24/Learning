## Understanding Conditionals and Loops
- **for** is used to execute a command on a range of items
```
for i in "$@"; do echo $1;done
```
- **while** is used to run a command as long as a condition is true
```
while true;do true;done #infinite loop
```
- **until** is used to run a command as long as a condition is not true
```
until who|grep $1;do echo $1 is not logged in;done
```
- **case** is used to run a command if a specific situation is true

## Using for
- useful for handling ranges or items or series of files
- defining a range to iterate over: **{x..y}**
```
for i in {114..130}; do echo $i;done
```

- `2>&1` redirects standard error (file handle 2) to the same file that standard output (file handle 1) is **currently** going to.

## Using case
- case is an efficient version of if then else
- used to check a specific number of cases
- case is case sensitive
	- consider using **tr** to convert all to a specific alphabet case

```
#!/bin/bash
echo how are you?
read MOOD
MOOD=$(echo $MOOD|tr [:upper:] [:lower:])
case $MOOD in
good|great|fine) # here | is used as option separator
        echo I am happy for you
        ;;
notgood|sad)
        echo I hope things get better for you
        ;;
*) # default case
        echo okay
        ;;
esac
```

## Using while and until
- are used to run commands based on exit status of an exp
- while will run as long as the exp is true
- until will run as long as the exp is false
- an integer can be treated as a string

```
COUNTER=${1:-1}
COUNTER=$(( COUNTER*60 ))

count(){
        COUNTER=$(( COUNTER-1 ))
        sleep 1
}


while [[ $COUNTER -gt 0 ]]
do
        echo $COUNTER seconds left
        count
done

echo timer has completed                                                                                                                                         
```
