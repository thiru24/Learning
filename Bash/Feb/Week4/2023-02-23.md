## What is DevOps?
- DevOps is a set of practices that combines s/w dev with IT operations
- in the old days of computing dev and IT ops are two diff fields
- if the developers know little bit about operations and operators know a little bit about development it will be easier for them to meet each others needs
- purpose of devops - > shorten the system development lifecycle
- generic approach
- can be implemented in different ways
	- CICD
	- Toolchains
	- 12 factor application development
	- deployment stategies
### Devops Toolchains
- typically used to bring an app from source code to full operation
- purpose of toolchain - > automate the process
- consists of 
	- coding by developer
	- building(code is built into something funcitonal)
	- testing
	- packaging(which makes the distribution of our app easier)
	- Releasing
	- configuring
	- monitoring

### CICD Pipeline
- continuous integration 
- continuous development
- we work with both of the above in a automated pipeline
- we can develop our source code and make the building of our source code automated

### 12 factor apps
- methodology for bulding SAAS apps
- defines different factors which should be used in the apps
- will be seen commonly in a containerized env
- diff components:
	- codebase :one code base that is tracked by revision control
	- dependencies: explicit and isolated dependencies
	- config: configuration as code, stored in the env
	- backing services: treated as attached resources
	- Build,Release, run: separate build and run stages
	- processes: execute the app as stateless process
	- port binding: to expose services
	- concurrency: the option to scale up and down
	- disposability: each instance can be replaced
	- dev/prod parity: keep all stages as similar as possible
	- Logs: treat logs as separate event streams
	- admin processes: treated separately

### Why shell scripting makes sense in DevOps
- irrespective of the Devops flow we are using , it all comes down to processing files through different stages
- this is a task that can be done perfectly using shell scripts
- Shell scripts, with the use of wide range of linux tools can be used to :
	- pickup a file
	- filter them
	- rename them
	- process them
- while using shell scripts in devops, they should be developed in an idempotent way

## Bash and other shells
- some C shell syntax are included in Bash as well
- in bash, different dialects can be used
- echo -> bourne style command. printf-> C-style command 
- to ensure that a Bash script is interpreted the right way, it should start with **#!/bin/bash**
	- especially if the env in which the script is run does not use bash natively

## Shell scripts vs Automation
- the aim of automation tools is configuration management
	- config files
	- states of installing s/w
- in automation tools like ansible, puppet, chef and others are used to get managed system in a desired state
- the desired state is often written in YAML
- the automation tool compares the current state of managed sys to the desired state and takes action if needed
- running the automation tool multiple times should not lead to anything different than the implementation of the desired state
	- idempotency
- bash script is not used to define a desired state
- a bash script defines actions to be accomplished
- managing idempotency in bash scripts is much harder to achieve
- automation tools and bash scripts are complimentary

## Powershell
- native shell for windows
- more than a shell
- complete scripting env
- for managing windows
