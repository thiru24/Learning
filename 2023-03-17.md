## Developing step by step
- use comments
- write and test each part separately
- use white lines to make script readable

## Using set options
- set can be used in a script to enable/disable specific functionality
	- set options can be specified in two ways:
		- using an option
		- using set -o option-name
		- ex: set -e and set -o errexit
- debugging option
	- set -x to enable
	- set +x to disable
- some useful options include:
	- -e: exit the script when a command fails
	- -i: runs the script in interactive mode
	- -v: runs a script in verbose mode
	- -x: runs a script in verbose mode whil expanding commands
- we can enable an option before a sections and disable afterwards
```
#!/bin/bash

echo 'in the script'
echo 'setting option -e'
set -e
false # generates error(exit code 0)
echo we do not see this, right?
O/p:
in the script
setting option -e
```

## Including debug information
- scripter can manually include debug information at critical points
- to do so, use echo and read
	1. echo just added the user, press enter to continue
	2.  read # not used with var because we are not going  to use it

## Writing debug info to a file
- using BASH_XTRACEFD
- when using bash -x, debug information is sent to STDERR
- since Bash 4.1, the BASH_XTRACEFD variable can be set to write debug information to a file
- this var defines a File descriptor that is next redirected to a specific file
- When using BASH_XTRACEFD, we will need a custom FD
- to defin this custom file descriptor, use exec
- exec 15 > myfile is sending all that is sent to FD 15 to the file myfile
- BASH_XTRACEFD is assigned to use this FD
```
exec 15>/tmp/bash-debug.log
export BASH_XTRACEFD=15

set -x
cd /etc
find
echo "that was it"
set +x
# closing the file descriptor
exec 15>&-
cat /tmp/bash-debug.log
```

## using bash -x
- instead of using the set options, we can use bash -x from the command line
- debugs entire script
- we can run on any script, no need to modify script
