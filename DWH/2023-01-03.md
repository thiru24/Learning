## [[Defining features of DWH]]
### Non Volatile Data:
- dwh is not updated everytime some a small business action takes palce.
- data movement into dwh is periodic
- majorly dependent on the business requirement
- all datasets might not require the same frequency
- all business txns insert/update/delete to the operational system databases in real time
- we do not insert/update/delete the data in the dwh realtime
- data updates not a common activity in dwh
- data in dwh not as volatile as the data in the operations db

### Data Granularity:

- in operational systems, the data is kept at the lowest level of detail
- ex: in a point-of-sale system at a grocery store, a txn is stored at the level of quantities of products involved in that transcation
- data stored in OpS is per transaction
- summary data not in OpS
- query results in dwh -> summarised ~ high level
- ex: sale of a product in India(highest level), sale of the same product in each state of India(one level down) etc...
- in dwh, it is efficient to keep data summarised at different levels
- analysis often goes from high level to low level
- data granularity in dwh refers to the level of detail
- lower the level of detail, higher the data granularity(lots of low level detail)
- if lower level detailed -> more storage needed
- data granularity decided based on the data types and expected system performance for queries

Before deciding to build a DWH, following questions are important to be considered:

1. Top-Down approach or bottom-up approach?
2. Enterprise-wide or departmental?
3. Which first - dwh or dm?
4. Build pilot or go full fledged?
5. dependent or independent dms?

A sigle enterprise wide dwh can feed data into departmental dms.
We can choose to build individual local dms, and combine them to form our overall dwh.
Local dms can be independent or dependent of each other.
