## ETL System
- consists of a work area, instantiated data structures, and a set of processes
- extraction - reading and understanding the source data and copying the data into the ETL system for futher manipulation
- 2nd step cleansing(correcting typos, standardizing)
	- combining data from multiple sources
	- deduplicating
- etl system adds value by cleansing and manipulations
	- we can even collect diagnostic metadata that could help in evolving the source system
- final step is loading data to presentational area's target dim models

## DW/BI Presentation Area
- where data is organized,stored and made available for querying
	- by users and tools
- ETL systems are off-limits
- this env is all that business sees
- data must be presented, stored and accessed in dimensional schemas
	- either olap cubes or relational star schemas
	- wide approved standard
- must contain detailed, atomic data
	- atomic data very important to deal with ad-hoc user queries
	- facilitates specific questions
- may contain performance enhancing agg data **as well**
- completely unacceptable to store only summary data in dim models
