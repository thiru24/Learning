## Using variables in function
- irrespective of where the variables are defined, they have a global scope
	- even if defined inside the functions
- use the local keyword to define variables with a local scope inside of a function
```
#!/bin/bash

var1="hello"
# creates a local var var2 and sets value, this does not affect the global variable var2
myfun () {
        local var2=my # only visible inside this function
        var3=dear # changing var3 without local keyword affects the global var
        echo $var1 $var2 $var3
}
echo before calling the function var1=$var1 var2=$var2 var3=$var3
myfun
echo after calling the function var1=$var1 var2=$var2 var3=$var3

O/P:
before calling the function var1=hello var2= var3=
hello my dear
after calling the function var1=hello var2= var3=dear
```


## Menus in Bash scripts
- the select statement can be used to select a menu
- PS3 is the prompt used by select inside shell script
- default PS4 is `#?`
- use PS3 to define a menu prompt
	- ps3  third prompt
	- ps4 is fourth prompt
		- ps3 and ps4 are custom prompts
	- ps1 is primary prompt -> that shows up when we open our terminal
	- ps2 is secondary prompt -> this is displayed when we type a multi line command
		- `>` is the default PS2
		- what we would get if we dont properly end a command
- select generates a menu from a list of items
- the prompt that select uses is the PS3
- when the select construct is invoked, each item from the given list is printed on the screen, preceded by number
	- after each item is printed, the prompt is displayed, waiting for a ip
- the user is supposed to enter a number, which will be stored in the variable $REPLY
	- if the number entered corresponds to one of the displayed items, then value of opt is set to the value of the user selected item
	- if an invalid number is entered, then the opt will not have a value
	- if the user input is empty, the prompt and the menu list is displayed again
- the select statement embeds a case statement
- the select loop will continue to run and prompt for user input until a break statment is executed from within
- use break to get out of the menu
- the select statement can refer to the choices directly, meaning select opt in heelo bello gelle.
	- if the choices contain spaces, we will need to use an array instead
```
#!/bin/bash

PS3="Enter your choice: "
options=("OPTION 1" "OPTION 2" "OPTION 3" "QUIT")

select opt in "${options[@]}" # select uses PS3 to promtp for choices
do
        case $opt in
                "OPTION 1")
                        echo "you have selected option 1"
                        ;;

                "OPTION 2")
                        echo "you have selected option 2"
                        ;;
                "OPTION 3")
                        echo "you have selected $REPLY with is $opt"
                        ;;
                "QUIT")
                        break
                        ;;
                *)
						echo The option variable for the invalid entry is $opt
                        echo "invalid option $REPLY"
                        ;;
        esac
done
```
- the menu can be exited using Ctrl + C

## Using trap
- trap is used to run a command as a response catching a signal
	- it traps the signal recceived by the program
- SIGKILL (kill -9) cannot be trapped
- signals are specific s/w interrupts that can be sent to a command
- use man 7 signal or trap -l for an overview
- trap is useful to run commands upon receiving a signal
- use it to catch signals that we dont want to happen in the script, like INT(ctrl c)
- or use it on exit, to define tasks that should happen when the script properly exits
	- this is better than just running a command at the end of the script, because that will only run if the script reaches the end

```
trap "echo ignoring signal" INT TERM # ignoring ctrl c and sigterm(15)
echo pid is $$ # displays PID
# this script can be killed by SIGKILL(9)
while : # colon is the useless command, it always executes successfully
do      # alternative to while true
	sleep 60
done
```

```
# designing a sccript to clean up on ctrl+C
#!/bin/bash
trap 'rm -f /tmp/ladder' INT # on receiving ctrl C, delete the file
rm /tmp/ladder 2>/dev/null
touch /tmp/ladder
ls -l /tmp/ladder
echo trap me if you can
sleep 300 # if this script naturally exits the file ladder exists
```

```
# designing a sccript to clean up on normal exit
#!/bin/bash

echo the PID is $$
rm -f /tmp/trapfile 2>/dev/null
touch /tmp/trapfile
ls -l /tmp/trapfile

sleep 5
trap 'rm -f /tmp/trapfile' EXIT # if the script reaches its natural end
# the rm command is executed
```

```
#!/bin/bash

ctrlc_count=0

function no_ctrlc()
{
        let ctrlc_count++
        echo
        if [[ $ctrlc_count == 1 ]]; then
                echo "Don\'t do that." 
        elif [[ $ctrlc_count == 2 ]]; then
                echo "if you\'re sure, do it once more." 
        else
                echo "Okay, bye."
                exit
        fi
}

# define the trap that reacts on ctrl-c
trap no_ctrlc SIGINT

# run the command on something that will be restarted after receiving SIGINT
# this fails if you do it on while sleep 10000
while true
do
        echo doing nothing for a long time
        sleep 10000
done
