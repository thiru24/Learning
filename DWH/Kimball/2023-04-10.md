## General Ledger Journal Txns
- complement to the periodic ss
- grain: one row for every general ledger journal entry txn
- the journal entry txn identifies the G/L account and the applicable debit or credit amount
- if the G/L trackes multiple sets of books, we need a ledger/book dim

## multiple Fiscal accounting calendars
- fiscal accounting periods often do not align with standard calendar months
	- ex: a company may have 13 4-week accounting periods in a fiscal year that begins on sept 1 rather than 12 monthly periods beginning on Jan1
- each day in a year correponds to a single calendar month and accounting period
	- irrespective of the fiscal calendar
	- the calendar and accounting periods are merely hierarchical attrs on the daily date dim
- we may deal with multiple fiscal accounting calendars that vary by line of business
- if the number of unique fiscal calendars is a fixed low number, then we can include each set of uniquely labeled fiscal calendar attrs on a single date dim
- if large number of different fiscal calendars
	- we could design the date dim with the official corporate fiscal calendar
	- for the other lines of businesses, create a date dim outrigger
		- one row for each day for each line of business
	- another approach, create a separate physical date dims for each line of business using a common set of surrogate date keys
		- likely to be used if the fact data were decentralized by each lob
		- one more FK in the FT which points to the subsidiary fiscal period dim table
