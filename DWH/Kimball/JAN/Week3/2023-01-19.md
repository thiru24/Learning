# Dimensional Modeling Myths

## Dim models are only for Predictable usage
- should not be designed by focusing on predefined reports are analyses
	- this list of predefinition is bound to change with time, then dim model should be designed newly to meet the new report requirement
- the design should center on measurement process
	- typically stable, not volatile as predefined reports
	- important to consider BI app's filtering and labeling requirements
- related corollary: dim models are not responsive to changing business needs
- not true. extremenly flexible and adaptive to change
- flexbility is high if fact table designed at lowest level of detail

## Dim models cannot be integrated
- can be integrated if conforms to the EDW bus architecture
	- if not then stand alone solutions
- data integration depends on standardized labels, values and definitions

# Chapter 2

## fundamental concepts of Kimball Dim modeling Tech:
### Gather Business Requirements and Data Realities
-  before launching dim modeling effort:
	- understand business needs
	- realities of underlying source data
- requirements uncovered by sessions with business reps
	- supporting analytic needs for decisions
	- decision making processes
- realities known by working with source sys experts
	- doing high level data profiling to assess data feasibilities
## Collaborative Dim modeling WorkShops
- should be designed in collab with 
	- subject matter experts
	- data governance reps 
## Four Step Dim design process:
1. Select the business process
2. Declare the grain
3. Identify the dims
4. Identify the facts
- The above decisions can be made better by [[2023-01-19#Gather Business Requirements and Data Realities]], [[2023-01-19#Collaborative Dim modeling WorkShops]]
- after these four decisions are made ->table and column names, business rules
