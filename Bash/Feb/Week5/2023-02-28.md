## Core bash Script ingredients
- best practice: make sure scripts always include the following:
	- shebang: the indicator of the shell used to run the script on the first line of the script
		- **#!/bin/bash** or **#!/usr/bin/env bash** to identify bash as the script interpreter
		- in old days default location for bash was /bin/
		- now /bin is not an ordinary dir anymore
		- and everything that previously was in /bin should now be in /usr/bin
		- second option in the above shebangs is more forward compatible
		- **#!/usr/bin/env bash** - > takes bash from our env and it will find the variable that points us to the correct bash shell
- comment to explain whats the script is doing
- white lines to increase readability
- different block of code to easily distinguish b/w parts of the scripts
- script names are arbitrary
- extensions are not required but may be convenient for script users from non-linux OS
- because of Linux $PATH restrictions, scripts cannot be executed from the curr dir
- consider using ~/bin to store scripts for personal use
	- make sure to modify the path
- consider using /usr/local/bin for scripts that should be available for all users
	- need sudo prev
- git clone https://github.com/sandervanvugt/bash-scripting
- for the shell script to be executed there are two ways
	- bash script_path.sh
	- or change permission to executable and then run using ./hello_world.sh
- when I copied my hello_world.sh to /usr/local/bin, I had to run hello_world.sh and not just hello_world

## Running the scripts
- if the directory containing the script is not in the $PATH var, run it using ./myscript
	- assuming that the script is executable
- scripts can also be started as an argument to the shell, in which case no execute permission and $PATH is needed: bash myscript
	-  because bash is the executable and the script is just an argument
- BEST PRACTICE: include shebang and put the script path in $PATH so that it can be run as an individual prog and should be executable

## Finding help about scripts
- **help** provides an overview of Bash internal commands
- **man bash** offers more detailed info about the commands
- https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
- search for bash scripting guide

# Working with Var and args
## About terminology
- argument -> anything that can be put behind the name of a command or a script
	- ls -l /etc has 2 args
- an option - > argument that changes the behavior of the command or script and its functionality is programmed into the command
	- options are always arguments
	- but arguments are not always options
- positional parameter -> another word for an argument
- variable - > key with a name that can refer to a specific value
- all arg, options are treated as vars inside the script
