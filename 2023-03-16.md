## Reading command outputs into arrays
- use **mapfile** to fill an array with the result of a command
	- **mapfile -t my_array < <( my_command )**
- we can also use loop that adds each item in the o/p, one by one
```
myarray=()
while IFS= read -r line; # followed by IFS is space
do 
	myarray+=( "$line" )
done < <(my_command) # space b/w < <, no space b/w second < and command
```
- in the above code snippet:
	- IFS - > internal field separator, sets it as space for the read command 
	- read -r -> does not treat backslashes as escape characters
	- as long as elements are found in my_command, the loop continues
- **readarray** is a relatively new soln that allows us to put the result of a command in an array
	- looks very similar to mapfile command
```
readarray -t my_array < <(seq 5)
declare -p my_array # prints the array
readarray -t myfiles < <(ls) # creates an index array with elements as files in the current dir
```

### Alternate approach

```
mapfile -t hosts < <(blah blah) # it is not necessary that hosts should be defined prior
```
```
mapfile -t -d: hosts < <(cat /etc/passwd) # defining : as a delimiter
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 
do
	echo "${hosts[$i]}" 
done
O/p
x
0
0
root
/root
```
## Looping through arrays
```
for i in 1 2 3 4
do 
	echo $i
done
```
