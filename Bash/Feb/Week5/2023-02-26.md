## Shell Patterns
- patterns that allow us to refer to texts in a flexible way
- two ways
	1. Regular expressions
		- used in specific tools
	2. Globbing
		- file patterns
		- * matches 0 or more chars
		- ? 1 char
		- [...] matches any of the characters listed
		- extended globbing provides additional options
			- must be enabled
			- **shopt +s extglob**
				- ?(patterns) : matches 0 or 1 occurences of pattern
				- \*(patterns) : matches 0 or more occurences of pattern
				- +(patterns) : matches 1 or more occurences of pattern
				- @(patterns): matches one occurence of pattern
				- !(patterns) : except pattern
				- all the above pattern matching samples are only possible by enabling ext globbing

## Using grep
- generic regular expression parser
- external command that helps in filtering text
- use it to find files containing specific text
- filter command output on occurrence of specific text
- when using grep, it is recommended to put the text pattern you're searching for b/w the single quotes
	- to avoid interpretation by shell
	- because the shell does command line parsing
- ex:
	- grep 'root' *
		- find occurence of root in files in current dir
	- ps aux | grep 'ssh'
	- -A followed by a number option : line where pattern matched and the number of lines after it
	- -B followed by a number option : line where pattern matched and the number of lines before it
	- -v -> to exclude
	- -l -> list only file names where matched

## Regular expressions
- text patterns that are used by tools like grep and others
- regex always inside single quotes
- not globbing
- tools: grep, vim, awk, sed
- basic regular expressions work wtih most tools
- extended regex dont work always
	- use grep -E -> when using extended regex
	- or egrep
- built around atoms
	- atoms -> specifies what text to be matched
	- can be single char, a range of chars or dot if we dont know the character
	- can be class \[\[:alpha:]] \[\[:upper:]] \[\[:alnum:]] 
- second element is the repetition operator, how many times should something occur
- third element -> where to find the next char

## Using cut and sort
- cut
	- allows us to filter out fields
	- based on a field separator
	- -d-> delimiter option, should be followed with the separator
	- -f -> field
- sort
	- allows us to sort items
	- without any options, sort will happen based on the order of chars in the ASCII table
		- sort -n -> numeric sort
		- sort -d -> dictionary order
		- -t -> delimiter
- commands like cut, and many more, work based on the internal field separator(IFS)
- IFS by default is a space
