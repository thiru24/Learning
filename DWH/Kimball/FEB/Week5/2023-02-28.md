## Inventory periodic snapshots contd
- dense snapshot tables
- there may be one row every day for every product in every store
	- for out of stock an explicit row will be included
- as the size may get out of hand very soon, there may be compromises
	- the last 60 days of data at a granular level -> period: daily
	- weekly snapshots for historical data

## Semi additive facts
- in inventory:
	- quantity on hand can be summarized across 
		- products
		- stores
	- not additive across dates
- because the fact is additive across some dims and not the other -> semi-additive facts
- most sensible thing to do with semi additive facts is to average them
- all measures that record a static level(inventory levels, financial account balances and measures of intensity such as temp) are inherently non additive across time and other dims
	- agg them using avg, max ,min
- SQL AVG fn cannot be used
	- problematic when grouping across many dims
	- ex: avg daily inv of a brand with three products in a geographic region(4stores) during a week(7 days)
		- AVG would divide by 84(7x3x4)
		- actually we should have divided by 7 for a week avg
- OLAP products provide the capability to specify agg rules
	- so less problematic if data is deployed via Olap cubes

## Enhanced inventory facts
- quantity on hand alone is not enough fact
- additional facts needed to calculate 
	- velocity of inv movement
	- number of turns
	- number of days of supply
- one additional fact is quantity sold
- for daily inventory snapshots, number of turns for each day = quantity sold / quantity on hand
- number of days of supply over a timespan = final quantity on hand/average quantity sold
- the new inv fact table looks like the following

- in some facts storing the following makes sence:
	- beginning balance
	- the inventory of change or delta
	- ending balance

## Inventory txns
- so far we modeled for stores inventory
- we move up and model now for the WH
- every txn that affects the inventory
- inventory txns in the wh might include
	- Receive product
	- place the product into inspection hold
	- release product from inspection hold
	- return product to vendor due to inspection failure
	- place product in bin
	- pick product from bin
	- package product for shipment
	- ship product to customer
	- receive product from customer
	- return product to inventory from customer return
	- remove product from inventory
- one row per inventory txn

- capable of answering frequency and timing related questions
- if a txn's dimensionality varies by event then a series of related fact tables should be created rather than capturing all inventory txn in single fact tables
- if a performance measurement has diff dimensionality or granularity they likely result from separate processes 
	- model as separate fact
