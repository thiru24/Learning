## Step 2: Detect the grain
- declaring what a single row of a fact table represents
- level of detail associated with the fact table measurements
- determined based on the OS
	- because OSs captures the business process's events
- ex grains:
	- One row per scan of an individual product on a customer's sales txn
	- one row per line item on a bill from a doctor
	- one row per individual boarding pass scanned at an airport gate
	- one row per bank account each month
	- one row per daily snapshot of inventory for one product in a WH
- expressed in business terms
- but grain is ultimately equal to the primary key
- very  important step
- if we find out in step 3,4 that the grain is not suitable - revisit step 2

## Step 3: Identify the dimensions:
- how do business people describe the data resulting from the business process measurement event?
- fill fact table with strong dimensions
	- meaning fully descriptive
	- the descriptions should be single valued for each measurement
- easy if step 2 is done
- common dims:
	- date
	- customer
	- employee
	- facility

## Step 4: identify the facts
- what is the process measuring?
- should conform to grain defined in step2
- facts that do not conform to the grain should appear in another fact table
- typical facts:
	- numeric additive figures
		- dollar cost amount
		- quantity ordered
- be mindful about user requirements and data realities
- do not model data just by looking at the source data alone

- data is collected in several places in a retail store
	- most useful data collected at the cash register
- Point of sale(POS) system scans the barcode at the cash register
- other data captured at the back door where vendors make deliveries
- pricing and promotions very important
- DW/BI project should first consider the most critical BP as well as the most feasible
- considerations for feasibility:
	- data availability and quality 
	- organizational readiness
- in grocery store, concern is logistics of : 
	- ordering 
	- stocking 
	- selling at maximized profit
- develop a dimensional model representing the most detailed, atomic information captured by a BP
- users can summarize data easily
- hard to break down summarized data
- in retail case: most granular data: product on a POS txn
- queries however will not want to see individual rows
	- but the grain gives the flexibility
