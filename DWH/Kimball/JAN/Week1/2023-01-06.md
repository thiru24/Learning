## Star Schema vs. OLAP Cubes

- dimensional models implemented in RDBMS are called as Star Schemas
	- because of their resemblance to a star like structure.
- dimensional models implemented in multidimensional database environments(DW/BI i guess) are reffered to as OLAP cubes
- both stars and cubes have a common logical design with recognizable dimensions
	- the physical implementation differs

- when the data is loaded into OLAP cubes, it is stored and indexed using formats and techs that are designed for dimensional data
.... confusing ....

## Fact tables for Measurements

- fact tables in a DimMo stores the performance measurements from a org's business process
- store low level measurement data resulting from a business process only in a single dim mod
- low level measurement data should not be replicated
- allowing users to use a single repo of measurements data ensures the use consistent data
- the term fact represents a business measure
- each row in a fact table corresponds to a measurement event
- the data on each row is at a sepcific level of detail, refered to as grain
	- ex: one row per product sold on a sales transaction, every row in a table corresponds to a transaction
- one of the main characteristic of dimensional modeling is that every measurement rows should be  at the same level
	- making sure every row corresponds to a sale of one product(can be any quantity) belonging to a transaction
- the most useful facts are numeric and additive
	- because from fact tables we query millions of rows and the most useful thing to do is add them up
- there can be semi-additive facts and non-additive facts
	- semi-additive facts - > account balance -> cannot be summed across time dim
	- non-additive facts - > unit prices -> cannot be summed across any dim
- for these facts, we are forced to perform counts/averages or at the worst print out each row
- designer should make every effort to put textual data into dimensions
	- takes less space as it will not be repeated that often
- should not store redundant text data in fact tables
	- unless text is unique for every row
- if there is nothing to measure for a particular entity, there should not be a record relating to it in fact table
	- ex: product which was not sold
- fact table deep in terms of number of row and narrow in terms of number of columns
- fact table grains fall into one of the below categories ^c9be2a
	1. transaction
	2. periodic snapshot
	3. accumulating snapshot
- all fact tables have 2 or more foreign keys(FK) that connects to dimension tables
- when all FK in a fact table matches a corresponding key in their dimension tables, the tables satisfy [[referential integrity]]
- fact table has it's own PK, which is usually composed of a subset of the FK
	- composit key
- fact tables express many to many relationships
- every table that has a composite key is a fact table
