## Shrunken Rollup Conformed dim with Attribute Subset
- dims also conform when they consist a subset attr from a much granular dim
- shrunken rollup dim needed when the fact table captures performance metrics at a higher level of granularity than the atomic base dimension
	- ex: weekly snapshot
- sometimes the facts are produced by the BP are at a higher level of granularity
	- ex: forecasting sales generate data at brand level and not product level
	- here brand and product dims do conform if the brand table's(because forecast is at the brand level) attrs are strict subset of the atomic product table's attr
- attrs that are common to both detailed and rolled up dim tables, such as the brand and category should be:
	- labeled
	- defind
	- identically valued
- the primary key of the atomic and rolled up dim tables are separate
- summary: Shrunken rollup dims conform to the basic atomic dim if the attrs are a strict subset of the atomic dim's attrs

## Shrunken Conformed dim with Row subset
- when two dims are at the same level of detail but one represents only a subset of rows
	- ex:
		- corporate product dim contains rows for full portfolio of products across diff lines of business
		- analysts in separate depts may want to view only their subset of rows
		- the fact table joined with this new subset dim should have only keys that are part of this sub dim

- conformed date and month dims are ex of both row and col dim subsetting

## Shrunken Conformed dim on the bus matrix
- bus matrix identifies the reuse of common dims across bp
- two ways to include these conformances in BM:
	- mark the cell for atomic dim and then textually document the roll up or row subset granularity within the cell
	- subdivide the column to indicate the common rollup or subset granularity

## Limited conformity:
- come cases, it may not  be realistic or necessary to establish conformity
- for conglomerates that have diff businesses are of varied industries -> not reasonable to integrate
- some attrs might be common across business lines
	- try for some level of integration
