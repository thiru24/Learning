## Facts and Dimensions Joined in a Star Schema:

- in a dim model 
	- 1 fact table 
	- multiple dim tables
- this characteristic star-like structure is called a star join
- dim model is extensible
	- new facts can be added to the fact table as long as they are consistent with the existing grain
	- new dimensions can be added to the model as long as there is a single field of that dimension present for every fact
	- the dims can be extended with new attributes to better describe them

- 4 components:
	- operational source systems
	- ETL system
	- data presentation area
	- business intelligence apps
### Operational source systems:
- systems that capture the business transactions
- outside the dwh
- little or no control over the content and format of the data that is collected
- maintains very little historical data
- queried in a very simple way, one record at a time
- in many cases, these are systems that do not share data with other operational systems in the org
