## EDWH bus matrix
- used to document and comms the bus architecture
	- aka conformance or event matrix
 ![[Pasted image 20230303105341.png]]
 - after individual business process are enumerated we might identify some consolidated processes
	 - dim models that cross bp can be helpful in performance and ease of use
	 - put load on ETL, as additional sources are integrated to one dim model
- ex for consolidated process - > profitability
	- in which separate revenue and cost factors are combined from diff processes to provide a complete view of profitability
- columns in the matrix - > common dimensions that are used across
	- create a list of core dimensions before filling in the matrix

## Multiple matrix uses
- creating DWBM is one of the important deliverables in DW/BI implementation
- it is hybrid resource
	- serves many purposes
		- architectural planning
		- database design
		- data governance coordination (how the data is generated,stored and processed)
		- project estimating
		- organizational comms
- core dims participating in multiple DM are defined by Data Governance people and built by the DW/BI team

## Oppurtunity and stakeholder matrix
- rows: business process, col: business functions
	- departments

## Common bus matrix mistakes
- people struggle with level of detail expressed by each row, rows should not be
	- departmental
	- report centric
		- dim models should not be centered around report requirements
		- a single BP can source multiple reports
- column level mistakes
	- overly generalized columns
		- ex: a person column can mean many things
			- employee, suppliers, customers
			- especially confusing bcos the above entities are almost uncorrelated in most context
			- the dim becomes generic
			- each entity above has diff attrs, the same attr might not apply to all
	- separate columns for each level of a hierarchy
		- columns of the matrix should represent dims at their most granular level
		- some bp might need an agged version of the detailed dimension
			- inventory periodic snapshot
			- rather than creating separate columns for each level of calendar hierarchy, have one column called date
				- granularity can be specified in the cell
				- or subdivide date column to indicate hierarchy
			- same dim that is used in diff granularity should be only one col in the bus matrix
