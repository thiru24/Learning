## Arrays

- the string is the default type of param
- integers are parameter types that can be used in calculations
- array is a parameter that can hold multiple values, stored as key/value pairs, where each value can be addressed individually
- strings may contain multiple elements
	- there is not standard way to address these elements individually
	- mainly due to spaces in the elements that appear in the string
	- spaces distort the arrangement
- string: files=$(ls \*.doc);cp $files ~/backup - > will throw an error, if it encounters files with spaces in their names
- array: files=(\*.txt); cp "${files\[@\]}" ~/backup -> file names with spaces are treated as one single name
```
files=(*.txt)# returns an array where each text file is an element
echo "${files[@]}" # arrays should always be in double quotes
O/P: all txt files in the current dir
files=$(ls *.txt) #returns a string
```
- every single files will be addressable in the files=(\*.txt) variable
- files\[@\] - > allows us to address every single element successfuly
- to ensure that lists of things that need to be processed always work, use arrays

## Types of arrays
- index arrays address a value by using an index number
	- index arrays are very common
	- the declare command does not have to be used to define an index array
	- index numbers are automatically attributed
- associative arrays address a value by using a name
	- associative arrays provide the benefit of using meaningful keys
	- associative arrays are relatively new
	- while using associative arrays, we must use "declare -A"

## Using arrays
- index arrays:
	- defined much like variables
	- all elements are put b/w braces
	- in the indexed array, the key is an index value, starting with 0
	- defining index arrays:
		- my_array=(one two three)
	- the above is not command substituition
- associative arrays use user defined strings as the key
	- $(value[XLY])
	- ordering in associative arrays cannot be guaranteed

- arrays should always be used with quotes, without quotes we will lose the array benefits and our script may fail over spaces
- "${myarray[@]}" refers to all values in the array
- "${myarray[0]}" refers to index value 0(first element) 
- "${!myarray[@]}" refers to only all keys in the array
- "${#myarray[@]}" refers to length of the array

```
for i in "${!myarray[@]}
do
	echo "$i" "${myarray[$i]}"
done
myarray[9]=b # possible, even if the array has less than 8 elements
myarray+=( x y ) # appending to an array
declare -A myarrayy # associative array
myarrayy=([value1]=cow [value2]=sheep)
```
