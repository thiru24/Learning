1. the retail use case, the critical business process that business wants to understand immideately = retail pos txn
2. in retail case: most granular data: one row per product on a POS txn - grain
3. a careful grain statement determines the primary dimensionality(number of dimensions) of the fact table, basic dims: product, txn
	- we can then add extra dims
		- but should make sure that for the combination of primary dims for a fact, the additional dim takes only one value
		- if there is a need to add one more row in the fact table to accomodate additional 
		 dims -> violation.
		 - check the grain again or disqualify the dimension
	- in our case the possible dimensions are: product,date store,promotion,cashier,method of payment, POS transaction ticket number(degenerate dim)
4. which facts should appear in the final table
	- when considering prospective facts, we might want to revisit step 2,3
	- some facts in this case: quantity, per unit price, discount, net paid price, extended discount, sales dollar amounts
-  ![[Pasted image 20230213105452.png]]
- extended sales dollar amount = quantity * Reg unit price
- extended discount dollar amount = quantity * discount unit price

## derived facts
- gross profit = extended cost dollar amount - extended sales dollar amount
- this is a derived fact, from the primitive facts(ECDA,ESDA)
- recommended to store derived facts in the fact table itself
- the calculations for derived facts are taken care as part of ETL
	- removing the possibility of error if the user calculates it
- we can also use a view to calculate derived facts
	- this also removes user error
	- no storage costs
	- but views can be bypassed by the ad hoc query tools, they might directly go to the fact table
	- if views are used, DBA must ensure that it is the only way data of the fact table is accessed
	- sometimes non additive facts: percentages, ratios are to be calculated using the BI tool
		- olap cube is best at it
