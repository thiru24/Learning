## Type 0: Retain original
- appropriate for any attr labeled original
- applies to most attributes in a date dim
![[2023-01-31#type 0:]]

## Type 1: Overwrite
- overwrite the old attribute value in the dim row
	- replacing it with current value
	- attr always consist of most recent assignment

- in this case, no dim or ft keys were modified
- fact table rows still point to the same dim record
- is simplest approach
- but we cannot understand how the change of attribute value affected the performance
- so type 1 appropriate only if there is no value in keeping the old description
- aggregation results will change after overwrite
- so if a dim model is deployed via an OLAP cube and the attr with SCD1 is a grouping attr -> reprocess the cube
- type 1 changes invalidate relational tables and OLAP cubes
- any pre existing agg on the changed column need to be rebuilt

## Type 2: Add new row
- predominant technique to correctly represent history
![[Pasted image 20230314104024.png]]
- the ft remains untouched
- post jan 31st, the fact table rows will point to dim SK 25984
- unlike type1, we don't need to revisit preexisting agg tables when using the type 2 tech
- OLAP cubes dont have to be reprocessed
	- if the grouping attrs are handled by type2
- to count the products, SK cannot be used -> use distinct count on NK
- NK very important while using type 2 -> only attr that uniquely denotes that denotes that both rows represent one product in the above case

### Type 2 Effective and expiration date
- these two attrs very important when implementing type 2
- the expiration date, when we expire a row, should be just prior to the effective date of the new row 
	- there should not be any gaps b/w these dates
- the definition of just prior depends on the grain of the changes being tracked
- if more granular than a day -> TimeStamp
- current row indicator is another useful attr
	- these attrs are all called administrative attrs
- type2 only possible with SKs, not with NKs
